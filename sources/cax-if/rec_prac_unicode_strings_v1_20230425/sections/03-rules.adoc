== Rules

PMI Unicode strings are specified by four items:

. *Keywords* for the type of PMI being represented as a Unicode string (<<sec-3.2>>)
. *Symbols* used for GD&T, welds, and surface finish that are defined by Unicode
characters (<<sec-3>>)
. *Delimiters* (<<sec-4>>) which group information into compartments (<<sec-3.4>>)
. *Numeric values and text* related to dimensions, tolerances, etc.

The rules for these four items allow the creation of the most used types of
graphic annotation found on a CAD model.

[[sec-3.1]]
=== Example

PMI Unicode strings are used in a STEP file for the PMI validation property for
'equivalent Unicode string.' They are described in the CAx-IF Recommended Practice
for the Representation and Presentation of PMI (AP242) for graphic PMI
(section 10.2.3.3.1) and semantic PMI (section 10.1.3.3).

For example, the following perpendicularity tolerance:

[%unnumbered,height=30px]
image::img01.png[]

would be represented by the following equivalent Unicode string:

**FCF\**w\X2&#x5C;**23CA**\X0\w.**010\**w**A**

where:

* *FCF* is the keyword for a Feature Control Frame,
* *23CA* is the Unicode character for the perpendicularity symbol,
* *.010* is the magnitude of the tolerance zone,
* *A* is the datum reference frame, and
* three delimiters *\w* separates the compartments of the Feature Control Frame.

The delimiters *\X2\* and *\X0\* are used to indicate that *23CA* is a Unicode
character. https://www.steptools.com/stds/step/IS_final_p21e3.html[ISO 10303 Part 21]
clause 6.4.3.3 defines the X2 encoding for 4 hexadecimal character
representations. Each set of 4 hexadecimal characters represents a character or
symbol defined by the http://www.unicode.org/[Unicode tables]. Symbols used for
equivalent Unicode strings are defined in <<sec-3.3>>.

In a STEP file, the equivalent Unicode string appears on the `description`
attribute of the `descriptive_representation_item` entity. For example:

[%unnumbered]
----
#1=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string',
   'FCF\\w\X2\23CA\X0\\w.010\\wA');
----

Note that the backslashes for the \w delimiter are 'escaped' by having a preceding
backslash before them. This is defined in ISO 10303 Part 21 clause 6.4.3.1 and
applies to any backslash (reverse solidus), except the backslashes associated with
X2 and X0 do not have a preceding backslash. Also, note that 'unicode' is lowercase.

The
https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/step-file-analyzer-and-viewer[NIST STEP File Analyzer and Viewer]
(SFA) can interpret the equivalent Unicode string
on `DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM`.

The following entities:

[%unnumbered]
----
#1=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string',
  'FCF\\w\X2\23CA\X0\\w.010\\wA');
#2=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string',
  'FCF\\w\X2\2313\X0\\\w.020\\wA\\wB\\wC');
#3=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string',
  'DIM\\w\X2\2300\X0\0.25 \X2\00B1\X0\0.008');
#4=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string',
  'DIM\\w4X \X2\2300\X0\.250\\u.+003\\n.-001\\u');
#5=DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM('equivalent unicode string','DTM\\wA');
----

are reported by SFA on the `DESCRIPTIVE_REPRESENTATION_ITEM` worksheet as:

[%unnumbered]
image::img02.png[]

In column C, the Unicode character is replaced by the correct symbol. In column D,
the delimiter *\w* is replaced by a *|* to delimit the compartments of the string.
In cell D7, the *\n* is interpreted as a new line.

The `\S` encoding is no longer recommended.

=== GD&T Characteristic Symbols

The following table shows geometric characteristics and modifying symbols and how
they are represented as a Unicode character, plain text, or other format defined
in the following sections. The
https://www.mbx-if.org/cax/cax_recommPractice.php[CAx-IF Recommended Practice for Representation and Presentation of Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) (AP242)]
also shows the symbols and how they are used on specific STEP entities.
Subsequent examples in this document show the symbol rather than the Unicode
characters associated with the symbol. Symbols that don't have a Unicode
representation should use FFFD.

[[sec-3.4]]
=== Compartments

A compartment is distinct segregated information within an annotation entity that
contains a discrete purpose or meaning.

[[sec-3.4.1]]
==== Compartments in GD&T

Certain GD&T entities contain distinct areas that have a particular meaning and
are subdivided into separate compartments. Entities that contain compartments
include Dimensions, Feature Control Frames (ASME) or Tolerance Frames (ISO), Datum
Target Symbols, and Datum Feature Symbols, to name a few.

[%unnumbered,options=header,cols=2]
|===
| Entity | Description

a| [%unnumbered,height=90px]
image::img06.png[]
| Stacked Tolerance values defined in a compartment.

a| [%unnumbered,height=90px]
image::img07.png[]
| Each frame in a feature control frame is a compartment. This example contains 5 compartments.

a| [%unnumbered,height=90px]
image::img08.png[]
| Each frame in a feature control frame is a compartment. Compartments can span multiple lines of information (highlighted in red in the image) by inserting a new line at the end of the first line. This example contains 8 compartments.
|===

[[sec-3.4.2]]
==== Compartments in Weld Symbols

Weld symbols have a defined layout, containing areas where specific information is
located, referred to as zones. Zones are defined in detail in the Basic Welding
Symbol Layout definition within the Welding Terms in <<sec-8>>.

[%unnumbered,options=header,cols=2]
|===
| Entity | Description

a| [%unnumbered,height=150px]
image::img09.png[]
| Example weld symbol with zones outlined. Zone 1 is empty in this example.
|===

[[sec-3.4.3]]
==== Compartments in Surface Texture

Surface texture symbols have a defined layout, containing areas where specific
information is located, referred to as zones, and thus are conducive to
compartmentalization. Zones are defined in detail in the Surface Texture Symbol
Layout definition within the Surface Texture Terms & Delimiters <<sec-7>>.

[%unnumbered,options=header,cols=2]
|===
| Entity | Description

a| [%unnumbered,height=150px]
image::img10.png[]
| Stacked values kept together in compartments within surface finish zones. Zones 2 and 3 are empty in this example.
|===

[[sec-3.5]]
=== Unspecified Symbols

If an annotation contains symbols which are not handled in this document, the
unspecified symbols shall be replaced by a Unicode placeholder character, FFFD
Shown as: &#xFFFD;

This may be the case when company-specific guidelines are used to create the
original PMI in the 3D model, or when product definition standards are used.

[[sec-3.6]]
=== Other Terms & Definitions

[[sec-3.6.1]]
==== Concatenation

In the context of digital data, string concatenation is the operation of joining
more than one character string together. For example, concatenating the strings
"hello" and "world" would result in the string "helloworld."

In this document, each separate annotation entity that contains text or Unicode
characters is defined as a separate string. However, as many of these strings are
specified in a set and are related to one another, the strings may be concatenated
into a larger superstring. Each string that makes up the superstring is readily
identifiable as a separate string by its leading keyword, which will aid software
queries intending to extract or understand a particular string, and represents a
level of the semantic relationship between the constituent strings.

[[sec-3.6.2]]
==== Grouping

Grouping is when a set of objects are combined to make a group of information.
Grouping can be used to keep information within a compartment together.

[[sec-3.6.3]]
==== Mapping

Isolating and writing individual characters or groups of characters in an
annotation entity into distinct compartments or fields within a Unicode string.
Some strings only contain a single field, such as Dimension and Text strings, and
some contain multiple fields or compartments, such as Feature Control Frame and
Datum Target strings. Each field within a string may be composed of multiple
characters, including codes that explain formatting and placement (e.g., stacked
upper and lower limits, stacked + and -- tolerances, fractional values, etc.)
