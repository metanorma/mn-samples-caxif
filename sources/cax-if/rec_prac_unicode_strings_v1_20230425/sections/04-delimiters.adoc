== Delimiters / Operator Definitions

The following sections will discuss the use of the compartments, groupings, new
lines, stacked text, concatenation, and fractions.

[[sec-4.1]]
=== Compartment (Symbol: \w)

This delimiter represents a compartment. Unicode text strings are structured in
several fields that are separated by \w character set. For annotation entities
with compartmentalized data, the fields are mapped to correspond to the
appropriate compartment in the annotation entity.

This delimiter is not required at the end of the Unicode string to represent the
closing of the compartment, nor is it required to identify additional compartments
that do not contain information.

The is always a compartment delimiter after a keyword.

[[sec-4.2]]
=== Grouping (Symbol: \u)

Groups elements together to identify them as one entity, such as stacked
dimensions or information within a weld or surface finish zone. Typically used in
conjunction with \n. Each group must contain 2 \u delimiters. Groups can be nested.

[[sec-4.3]]
=== New Line / Stacked Text (Symbol: \n)

Use a hard carriage return to denote the following text occurs on a separate line.
This is a literal carriage return because a new line of characters begins below
the previous line, within the same string.

Use a soft return prior to text to denote a semantic separation. This would
include texts and symbols that belong to a single string of text, and are on the
same line, but are symbolically distinct. For example, the datum identifiers in a
feature control frame. This supports the top down left right rule that we have
designated for this specification.

NOTE: \n can also be used as a separator between strings in a concatenated
superstring.

[[sec-4.4]]
=== Concatenated Representation (Symbol: \x)

Joining of strings into a larger superstring. In the example, each separate line
is mapped as a distinct Unicode String, and each of these strings is concatenated
into a larger Unicode String. Without \x, four Unicode strings would be treated as
individual strings.

[[sec-4.5]]
=== Fraction (Symbol: \v)

This delimiter adds a horizontal line between information on the upper and lower
lines. Similar to \u, \v must be added at the beginning and ending of the
fraction. \n between the two values defines which information is above and below
the horizontal line.

NOTE: Dimensions do not have to be represented using the fraction format as shown
in the second example. The numerator and denominator can be separated using a / as
shown in the second example.
