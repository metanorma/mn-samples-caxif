== Surface Texture Terms & Delimiters

Surface texture (also known as surface finish) symbols define the lay
(direction), roughness and waviness of a surface. Various manufacturing processes
are used to achieve the desired surface texture on the finished part.

[[sec-7.1]]
=== Surface Texture Symbol Layout

To capture Surface Finish Symbols as a Unicode string, it is divided into
distinct regions, referred to as zones. The surface texture symbol layout from
Figure 4-2 of ASME Y14.36-2018 is shown and will be used to layout the zones as
labeled in that figure.

Information will be treated as plain text. There are no symbols used when
representing surface texture.

Following the convention of using compartments for annotations, the Unicode
string for a surface finish uses \w to separate zone information. In the example
below, zones 1 and 2 are empty as indicated by the first two occurrences of \w\w.

_Zones 1 and 2 are intentionally blank._

Delimiters for the surface texture symbol are listed below in order of the zones
that information is put in.

[[sec-7.2]]
=== Surface Texture Symbol (SRF)

Denotes a surface finish annotation.

Surface Texture Symbols are typically expanded, showing a horizontal line drawn
to the right of the longer angled leg of the basic surface texture symbol, unless
zones 3 and 4 of the symbol are empty.

=== Symbol Modifiers

Modifiers indicate parameters to be applied to a surface that vary from those
specified on a drawing or referenced specification sheet to specific surfaces.

[[sec-7.4]]
=== Material Removal Designator

The material removal designator is appended to the surface texture designator and
specifies if material removal is required. Graphically, the angled lines of the
surface texture symbol are modified to denote this information. Valid options are
listed below.

[[sec-7.4.1]]
==== Any Process Allowed (APA)

==== Material Removal Required (MRR)

==== No Material Removed (NMR)

[[sec-7.5]]
=== All Around and All Over Designator

The all around or all over designator define surfaces that require different
parameters than those stated in the title block or other specification. This
designator is captured as a suffix to the Material Removal designator.

[[sec-7.5.1]]
==== All Around (A)

Suffix to the process indicator on a surface texture annotation callout.

[%unnumbered,cols=2]
|===
a| [%unnumbered,height=70px]

| SRFAPA**A**\w1.6\n0.8\w\w\w0.8
|===

[[sec-7.5.2]]
==== Not All Around (N)

It is recommended that "N" be included in the Unicode string. Without the "N", it
is assumed that any character other than A or no character in the last position
implies that it is not all around.

[%unnumbered,cols=2]
|===
a| [%unnumbered,height=70px]

[[sec-7.5.3]]
==== All Over (AOS)

[%unnumbered,cols=2]
|===
a| [%unnumbered,height=50px]

a| [%unnumbered,height=50px]

a| SRFAPA\w\w\wTXT2.5/Ry 0.5

_No text after APA indicates the surface finish is not all over._

[[sec-7.6]]
=== Surface Finish Lay Symbols

The lay symbol indicates the direction of the surface marks of the surface
finish. The lay symbol is specified in zone 4 of the surface finish symbol. The
symbol is the first character on the second line. Even though some symbols are
the same as those used in GD&T, they are represented as plain text to maintain
consistency with ASME Y14.36-2018.
