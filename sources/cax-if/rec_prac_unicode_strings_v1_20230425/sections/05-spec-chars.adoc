== Specific Characters and Text

This section defines how characters with specific syntax, such as a character in a
circle or a spotface symbol, are identified. Characters that are not in this
section are defined as plain text.

[[sec-5.1]]
=== Characters Within Parenthesis

Information displayed inside parenthesis in a dimension does not require special
mapping. If it is desired to have parenthesis display as text that is not part of
the dimension information, the TXT indicator should be placed in front of it.

=== Characters Within a Shape

A single character surrounded by a circle, or more than one character surrounded
by an oval.

[[sec-5.2.1]]
==== Circle

Single letters in a circle used as geometric modifiers, such as Maximum Material
Condition. Unicode representations are available for all single letters in a
circle. Refer to for commonly used letters in a circle such, as &#x24C2;
represented with the Unicode string 24C2.

as defined in Section 6.9.3 of the
https://www.cax-if.eu/cax/cax_recommPractice.php[CAx-IF Recommended Practice for Representation and Presentation of PMI (AP242)].

of the https://www.cax-if.eu/cax/cax_recommPractice.php[CAx-IF Recommended Practice for Representation and Presentation of PMI (AP242)].

=== Characters Within Brackets

DIM with a numeric dimension in square brackets represent a basic dimension (see
<<sec-6.1>>).

FCF with square brackets represent a basic dim or degrees of freedom (see below).

TXT with square brackets represents text in a box.

[[sec-5.3.1]]
==== Degree of Freedom

Symbols: [x,y,z,u,v,w] in any combination

Used to indicate which Degrees of Freedom are eliminated by the Datum Feature
Simulator, potentially overriding the default conditions. Does not require all 6
symbols be displayed. Does not require the TXT delimiter to display as square
brackets in a feature control frame.

[[sec-5.3.2]]
==== Special Case -- Basic Dimensions

Symbols: [BSC] and [BASIC]

[BASIC], [BSC], and [value] are methods to override the default size/boundary for
Datum Feature Simulators. [BSC] is an abbreviation for [BASIC], which means the
basic size / shape. Used in a feature control frame, the TXT delimiter is not
required.

[[sec-5.4]]
=== Text

Text is a string of characters and symbols used to provide further information on
an annotation. Sections 5.1 through 0 define text representation in special cases
where the text carries specific meaning.

[[sec-5.4.1]]
==== General Text

Keyword: TXT

Denotes text with no context. Does not require its own separator before or after.

NOTE: A gap between symbols or text denotes a space as entered on a keyboard
(white space) and does not require mapping.

==== General Note

Keyword: NOTE

Subtypes of text can be used to provide a more semantic meaning. The delimiters
below can be used in place of NOTE.
