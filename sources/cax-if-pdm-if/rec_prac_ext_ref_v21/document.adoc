== External References Test Scenario

[[sec_1.1]]
=== Motivation

As CAx-PDM interaction becomes an increasingly common part of the business process,
guidelines are needed for how the information regarding exchanged models can be provided in a
way that both CAx and PDM systems can deal with it. The method presented here uses the so-called
"`External References`" approach. Therefore, the model is split during the export process
into several individual files, where the assembly structure is contained in one file, and the
individual parts in a single file each. The assembly structure in the master file links to its
components in the separate geometry files.

The 'master' file shall use the actual PDM Schema or the IS version of AP214-CC06 as its file
schema. It contains all the PDM-relevant information (e.g. part numbers, versions) along with the
model structure and associated information (e.g. validation properties). The leaf nodes of the
assembly tree then reference the appropriate geometry externally.

=== Nested External References

It has turned out that when dealing with large assemblies, it is often very unhandy to exchange
the complete structure in a single file. Especially when only a single part or small subassembly
of the assembly has been changed, transferring the complete structure means a lot of
unnecessary data exchange.

There, the mechanism for "`nested`" external references has been introduced, i.e. the "`master`" file
itself is split into several parts, where each file represented one node in the assembly structure.

The complete assembly structure is broken down level by level, and subassemblies are
referenced the same way as the single geometry parts.

A way to distinguish whether the referenced file is a single part (geometry) or a sub-assembly
(structure), is by using the Document Format Properties, see section 2.3. Therefore, all structure
files belonging to a split assembly structure shall include the document format property.

A first test case for nested external references is defined in the Round15J Test Suite document.

[[sec_1.3]]
=== Possible scenarios

There are basically two usage scenarios for the background of this document: CAx to CAx and
CAx to PDM exchange.

In CAx to CAx exchange, the set of STEP files is both written and read by – possibly different –
CAx systems. There may be various reasons to apply this functionality in this context.

In CAx to PDM exchange, the set of STEP files is written by a CAx system, while a PDM system
is on the receiving end. With this functionality, the PDM system only needs to read the '`master`'
file to obtain the full information needed. With regard to joint testing activities between the two
forums, a model may be generated from a PDM system, then imported and exported again by a
CAx system and finally fed back to the originating PDM system in order to see which information
could be maintained and which was lost.

[[sec_1.4]]
=== Scope of this document

This document gives an overview on how to apply the external reference mechanism described
in the PDM Schema Usage Guide (http://www.pdm-if.org/pdm_schema/) and is designed to give
the CAx vendors a guideline for their implementations. It therefore gives a list of relevant
sections in the PDM Schema Usage Guide.

[[sec_2]]
== Master File Structure

The structure within the master file which identifies the external references, i.e. links the
assembly nodes to their associated documents, has been harmonized between the CAx- and
PDM-IF. It is shown in the following diagram:

[[figure3]]

[[sec_2.1]]
=== Placement of the file name

The following agreement was made on where to put the file name for an external reference file in
the master file, and concerns the entities #49, #53, #54, and #55 in the diagram above.

[[sec_2.1.1]]
==== On import

* The post-processor should look for the file name first in `applied_external_identification_assignment(AEIA).assigned_id (#55)`.

* If the file name is there, it should be used.

* If the `AEIA` is there, but its `assigned_id` attribute is empty, look in `external_source.source_id (#53)`. This is to ensure downward compatibility with older files.

* If the `AEIA` is not there, take whatever is found in `document_file.file_id (#49)` and go on from there.

[[sec_2.1.2]]
==== On export

* Older (AP214 DIS), or AP203 1st Edition, processors, which do not support the `AEIA`, should put the file name into `document_file.file_id`.

* Newer, AP214 or PDM Schema, processors should create the AEIA and its appending entities, and put the file name into AEIA.assigned_id. The `external_source.source_id` (path information) should be left empty.

* In most cases, the unique identifier in `document_file.file_id` is a replicate of the file
name, not at last to ensure compatibility with older processors. (There are, however,
scenarios where this is not necessarily the case, e.g. if the uniqueness of the identifier
has been ensured company-wide, and there are several versions of the respective file.)

* The three entities below the `document_file` (`AEIA` + …) are there to exchange the
semantics, i.e. that the information found is indeed the name of the file as found on the
computer or storage media, and not any arbitrary identifier. In the light of pure CAD
systems providing external references, this information is not usually populated, but it
should be included to support other scenarios where additional path or source
information might become of vital importance.

* To sum this up, the recommendation to the CAx-IF participants on External Reference
export is:
** Put the file name into `AEIA.assigned_id`,
** And replicate file name into `document_file.file_id`, if a separate (unique) file
ID is not available.
** Use `external_source.source_id` for, e.g., path, directory, URL, hyperlink or
equivalent information.
** Leave `external_source.source_id` empty in the case of an asynchronous data
exchange.

[[sec_2.2]]
=== Important Notes:

* The following attributes shall have the same values in the master file, where an external
shape is referenced, and in the referenced file containing the respective shape:
+
--
** `shape_representation.name`
** `shape_repredentation.id`
** `product.id`
** `product.name`

where the consistency of the `shape_representation` attributes is of most importance.
--

* The last attribute in `document_file` (`characterized_object.description`) is required
to be `$` (not instantiated).

* Systems not supporting document management at all should skip the entities within the
blue box in <<figure3>> and link the `applied_document_reference.assigned_document`
directly to the `document_file` (in the example above, #455 would point to #49 instead of
#456).

* There is a known issue regarding the attribute values of `#54 identification_role`.
The AP214 mapping requires the `name` to be '`external document id and location`' and the
`description` attribute to be not instantiated ($). These values are not in the list of
recommended (allowed) values given in the PDM Schema Usage Guide. Since changing
the values in AP214 would require modifications to the mapping, for the time being, the
AP214 values will be added to the list in the PDM-UG.

A complete physical file according to this structure is available for reference testing.

[[sec_2.3]]
=== Document Format Properties

The Document Format is an additional property which completes the structure displayed in
<<figure3>>, and is attached to the `document_file` entity. It provides information about the data
format of this referenced file.

The format of the referenced file is stored in the `descriptive_representation_item.description`
(see <<figure5>>). Recommended values are:

* '`STEP AP203`' if the referenced file is a geometry file conforming to the first edition of
AP203

* '`STEP AP203E2`' if the referenced geometry file conforms to the second edition of AP203

* '`STEP AP214`' in case the referenced file is a geometry file in AP214 IS format

* '`STEP AP214 CC06`' if the referenced file contains a subassembly, and conforms to
AP214 CC06.

=== File Example

There is a set of example files available from the CAx-IF web site under “Joint Testing
Information”, dated 11-25-2002. It is based on the '`AS1`' test case. The master file is according to
the structure given above (not including document format properties or nested external
references), and all geometry files are based on AP214-IS.

[[sec_2.4.2]]
==== Leaf node geometry files

See files: nut_prt.stp, plate_prt.stp, rod_prt.stp, bolt_prt.stp, and I_bracket_prt.stp in the ZIP file.
