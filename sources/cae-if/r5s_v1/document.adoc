== Introduction

This document describes the suite of test cases to be used for the
test round R5S of the CAE Implementor Forum (CAE-IF). The CAE-IF is
a workgroup in the CAx Implementor Forum (CAx-IF), a joint testing
forum, organized and facilitated by AFNeT, PDES, Inc., and the prostep
ivip Association. The test rounds of the CAE-IF concentrate primarily
on testing the interoperability and compliance of STEP processors
based on AP209ed2.

The test rounds in general combine testing of synthetic and production
models. Production models will in most cases be provided by the member
companies of the organizations ANFeT, PDES, Inc., and prostep ivip
Association. When production models are not available from the member
companies, "`production-like`" models will be solicited from the various
CAE-IF participants.

This test suite includes synthetic models for testing the following
capabilities: export /import Input FEA models for 3D Linear Static
Structural Finite Element Analysis using simple models. More complex
models, including production models and dynamic analysis, will be
introduced later

[[sec_1.1]]
=== Functionality tested in this round

The main objective of the R5S test round is to check the implementation
of the Structural FEA validation properties (FEA VP) -load case level-
during an exchange using STEP AP209ed2 translators. Some of the FEA
VP –model level- which were not successfully tested in the R4S test
round have been kept.

The FEA validation properties are characteristic values of a finite
element analysis and are assigned during the export process inside
the STEP file with a specific format described in the corresponding
"`Recommended Practices`" document. During the import process, the
validation properties are read and compared with the re-calculated
values from the STEP file (see <<figure1>>). They should be used to
validate the success of the exchange process.

[[sec_1.2]]
=== General testing instructions for this round

The general procedures for communication of models and statistics
are outlined in a separate document, named 'General Testing Instructions'.
The document can be retrieved from the CAx Implementor Forum web sites.
The latest version is v1.13, dated Sept 29, 2017.

Therefore, the "`native statistics`" and "`target statistics`" will
be submitted to the CAESAR system according to the regular process
described in the '`General Testing Instructions`'. Specific statistics
will be used to check if the validation properties value assigned
in the STEP file are equal to the calculated values.

When reporting statistics related to validation properties in the
CAESAR system (see <<figure2>>)

* The corresponding "`native Val Prop. statistics`" value should be
set to the value assigned in the STEP file if the validation property
is implemented in the STEP file, or "`na`" otherwise;

* The corresponding "`target Val Prop. statistics`" value should be
the value read from the STEP file. It will be compared to the corresponding
"`target statistics`" recalculated value.

[[figure2]]
.Statistics related to Validation Properties
image::figure2.png[]

Key issues should be reported using the BRUTUS system
(see '`General Testing Instructions`').

Native FEA Model use NASTRAN card descriptions. Documentation of NASTRAN
input syntax is available in the "`NASTRAN quick reference guide`",
which can be download from the MSC homepage at:

* https://simcompanion.mscsoftware.com/infocenter/index?page=content&id=DOC11146&cat=MSC_NASTRAN_DOCUMENTATION_2017&actp=LIST

Original FEA model of each test case is available in the xx.bdf file.

NOTE: CAE models are generally "`unit consistent models`". This means
there is no need for data conversion. Participants are requested to
keep the original unit system unchanged and to deliver results and
statistics using the same unit system as the native models. Nevertheless,
*the units' definition shall be included in the STEP file*, as stated
in the recommended practices.

The validation properties shall be assigned in the native STEP file
as described in the "`Recommended Practices for Structural FEA validation
properties`" (v0.7 or higher).

[[sec_1.3]]
=== Testing Schedule

The following schedule has been agreed on for Round 5S:

[[figure3]]
.CAE-IF Round5S Schedule
image::figure3.png[]

The CAE-IF Round 5S Kickoff meeting will be held by confcall before
the PDES, Inc. Fall Offsite meeting and LOTAR workshop. Therefore,
a session will be dedicated to R5S during the Fall Offsite meeting
to discuss any feedback. Conference calls and web sessions will also
be available for those not attending the meeting to dial in.

The CAE-IF Round5S Review meeting will take place in conjunction with
a LOTAR meeting in Darmstadt. In addition, conference calls and web
sessions will be organized during the test round.

=== Copyrights on Test Cases

[[sec_1.4.1]]
==== CAE-IF

None of the production test cases which were provided by the AFNeT,
PDES, Inc. and prostep ivip member companies may be publicly released
for any purpose. The test cases can be freely distributed among the
CAE-IF members, and can be used for any purposes that are related
to CAE-IF testing (i.e. testing, documentation of testing efforts,
etc.), as long as a reference to the originating company is made.

The test cases must not be used for any purposes other than CAE-IF
testing or outside of ANFeT, PDES, Inc. and prostep ivip. Test cases
provided by the LOTAR project for testing of specific capabilities
are applicable to the same restrictions and may not be used outside
LOTAR or the CAE-IF.

=== Test Case ATS1: beam FEA model using rod elements

All information about this test case can also be viewed in CAESAR
on its Information page.

[[sec_2.1.1]]
==== Motivation

This test case is part of the simple ATSx series models focusing on
elementary CAE functionalities. The ATS1 test represents a beam using
"`rod`" elements only, with one lumped force applied.

Within the CAE domain, the following functionalities are in scope
of Round 5S:

* Export/import input data of 3D FEA models with
** 1D elements (rod elements), linear order,
** Lumped force and fixed boundary conditions
** Execution control statements

* Assignment of Structural FEA validation properties, typically :
** 1D size and centroid of the model,
** total mass,
** number of fixed DOF,
** resultant of applied forces,
** resultant moment of applied forces at a reference point.

[[sec_2.1.2]]
==== Approach

The approach to be used is described in the latest version of the
following documents:

* "`Recommended Practices for AP 209 ed2`" (at least version 2.0,
dated March 30, 2016)

[[sec_2.1.3.2]]
===== Test Model Access

The original NASTRAN files can be downloaded from the member area
of the CAx-IF homepages under "`General Information – File repository`"
in the folder "`CAE / ATSx simple test suite`":

* ATS1m5.bdf (input data)

[[sec_2.1.3.3]]
===== Test Model Configuration

The following functionality shall be included in the test files provided
for this round of testing, as far as it has been implemented by the
CAE-IF participants and is described in the Recommended Practices:

* [underline]#Validation Properties# -- All participants providing
STEP files for this test case should include newly defined FEA validation
properties as described in the "`Recommended Practices for Structural
FEA validation properties`" (v 0.7).

[[sec_2.1.4]]
==== Statistics
For each STEP file exported or imported for the ATS1 test case, participants
must submit the corresponding statistics to CAESAR. To do so, go to
the [ ATS1 Data Sheet ], and either fill in the web form, or upload
a comma-delimited file (.csv) with the data as listed below.

===== Native Statistics

When exporting a STEP file, report what data importing systems should
expect to find. For numeric statistics, enter the respective value
or 'na' if not supported. For other statistics, select either
'full support' (i.e. test case and Rec. Pracs. definitions are fulfilled),
'limited support' (meaning the implementation does not meet all criteria
and issues may be expected on import), or 'na' if not supported.

===== Target Statistics

When importing a STEP file, report the results found after processing
the file as described below. The value should be given in the unit
implicitly defined in the native model.

===== Load Case Selection

Some of the statistics for this test case are load case-related
(fixed DOF, applied force, applied moment). When statistics depend
on the load case and/or node selection, the item(s) to be considered
is indicated in the following table:

[cols="2",options="unnumbered"]
|===
h| Statistic h| Case 'A'

| Fixed DOF nb      | Load case #1

=== Test Case ATS4: beam FEA model using solid elements

All information about this test case can also be viewed in CAESAR
on its Information page.

[[sec_2.4.1]]
==== Motivation

This test case is part of the simple ATSx series models focusing on
elementary CAE functionalities. The ATS4 test represents a cantilever
beam using different "`solid`" elements, with combinations of lumped
applied forces.

Within the CAE domain, the following functionalities are in scope
of Round 5S:

* Export/import input data of 3D FEA models with
** 3D elements (solid elements), linear order,
** Combination of lumped forces and fixed boundary conditions
** Execution control statements

* Assignment of Structural FEA validation properties, typically:
** FEA bounding box,
** total mass,
** number of load cases,
** number of fixed DOF,
** resultant of applied forces,
** resultant moment of applied forces at a reference point.

[[sec_2.4.2]]
==== Approach

The approach to be used is described in the latest version of the
following documents:

* "`Recommended Practices for AP 209 ed2`" (at least version 2.0,
dated March 30, 2016)
* "`AP 209 ed2 Linear Static Structural FEA Handbook`" vol.1 - (at
least version v 2.2, dated May 16, 2018)
* "`AP 209 ed2 Linear Static Structural FEA Handbook`" vol. 2 -
(v 1.1, dated March 25, 2019).
* “Recommended Practices for Structural FEA validation properties
(v 0.7)

For the test round 5S, the assignment of validation properties is
mainly focused on "`load case level validation properties`".
These documents can be found either in the public area of the CAx-IF
website under "`Joint Testing Information`" or in the member area
of the CAx-IF website under "`Information on round 5S of testing`".

The AP 209 schema to be used is a corrected version of the AP 209
ed2 schema, which can be found in the member area of the CAx-IF website,
under "`Information on Round 5S of Testing`".

[[sec_2.4.3]]
==== Testing Instructions

The tests will be performed based on the ATS4m5 NASTRAN model described
below. This model has been developed by the LOTAR EAS Working Group,
and has been checked during previous pilot studies.

[[sec_2.4.3.1]]
===== Test Model Overview

The ATS4m5 model represents a beam (rectangular prism) idealized using
"`solid`" elements (mix of 4-noded tetrahedral, 6-noded pentahedral
and 8-noded hexahedral elements), with the following characteristics:

* Isotropic material property
* 3 load cases:
+
--
. axial distributed load in compressive (-x) direction
. lateral distributed load in bending (-y) direction
. combination of 1 + 2
--

[[sec_2.4.3.2]]
===== Test Model Access.

The original NASTRAN files can be downloaded from the member area
of the CAx-IF homepages under "`General Information – File repository`"
in the folder "`CAE / ATSx simple test suite`":

* ATS4m5.bdf (input data)

[[sec_2.4.3.3]]
===== Test Model Configuration

* See section <<sec_2.1.3.3>> above.

[[sec_2.4.4]]
==== Statistics

For each STEP file exported or imported for the ATS4 test case, participants
must submit the corresponding statistics. To do so, go to the [ ATS4
Data Sheet ], and either fill in the web form, or upload a comma-delimited
file (.csv) with the data as listed below.

===== Native Statistics

When exporting a STEP file, report what data importing systems should
expect to find. For numeric statistics, enter the respective value
or 'na' if not supported. For other statistics, select either
'full support' (i.e. test case and Rec. Pracs. definitions are fulfilled),
'limited support' (meaning the implementation does not meet all criteria
and issues may be expected on import), or 'na' if not supported.

===== Target Statistics

When importing a file, report the results found after processing the
file as described in the table below. The value should be given in
the unit implicitly defined in the native model.

===== Load Cases Selection

Some of the statistics for this test case are load case-related (fixed
DOF, applied force, applied moment). When statistics depend on the
load case and/or node selection, the item(s) to be considered is indicated
in the following table:

[cols="3",options="unnumbered"]
|===
h| Statistic h| Case 'A' h| Case 'B'

| Fixed DOF nb | Loadcase #1 | Loadcase #3
| Applied force | Loadcase #1 | Loadcase #3
| Applied moment
| Loadcase #1 +
Reference point : free (*)
| Loadcase #3 +
Reference point : free (*)
|===

(*) As stated in the "`Recommended practices for FEA VP`" document:

____
The position of this reference point is free, but should be specified
in order to keep the resultant value in a reasonable range. This is
why this reference point is not chosen necessarily as the origin of
the basic coordinate system. One of the centroid points or the corner
points of the FEA bounding box could be a good position for evaluating
the resultant moment.
____

During the export process, each participant will choose freely the
reference point for computing the resultant moment of the applied
forces, this point as well as the resultant will be assigned in the
validation property, and in the CAESAR system as native statistics.

During the import process, each participant should recover the reference
point from the validation property capability, assign it as
_target statistics_ in CAESAR, then recalculate the resultant moment
(relatively to this reference point) and assign it in the corresponding
_target statistic_ in CAESAR. The resultant moment values recovered
from the validation property capability should be assigned in the
corresponding _target validation statistic_. This value will be compared
to the recalculated value of the resultant moment to assess the success
of the exchange.

===== Applicable Units and Coordinate system

The model is based on imperial units (in, lbf).

Components of any point (such as Center of Gravity) or vector (such
as resultant of applied loads) should be calculated in the basic coordinate
system.

Note that CASEAR allows the addition of multiple screenshots per dataset.
