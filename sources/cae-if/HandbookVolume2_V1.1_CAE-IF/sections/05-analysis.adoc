== Analysis Control Structures

The remaining sections in this document discuss the source of FEA results
information and the mapping process to AP209 ed2 constructs. These topics are scoped
to the following:

* NASTRAN Analysis Control Overview
* Analysis Control Structures -- Structures used to describe the operations
performed on the FEM
* Steps and States -- Describe the specification or requesting of model variables
for a single execution of the solution process

=== NASTRAN Analysis Control Input Overview

The ATS pilot models are simplistic but useful to demonstrate the processes involved
in defining the solution controls and interpretation of results. A quick overview of
the NASTRAN solution control input information is presented prior to delving into
the AP209 ed2 data model mapping and implementation. A complete NASTRAN analysis
file is divided into five main input data sections:

* NASTRAN (NASTRAN Command) -- Allows specification of NASTRAN execution options
* FMS (File Management Section) -- Controls attachment and initialization of
database management sets and files
* EXEC (Executive Control Section) -- Selects solution sequences, alters and
diagnostics
* CASE (Case Control Section) -- Specifies load cases, loads, boundary conditions
and requests for output formats and output variables
* BULK (Bulk Data Section) -- Defines the FEA model along with input data required
for the selected solution sequence and subcases

The pilot models use the linear static analysis solution sequence (SOLUTION 101)
specified in the Executive Control Section. No further details of the linear static
solution sequence are presented in this document, but the details of the Case
Control and related Bulk Data Sections and their mapping to AP209 ed2 are discussed.
The reader can always explore more detailed explanations of the source information
by reviewing the NASTRAN Quick Reference Guide (available online). The documentation
is organized by the sections outlined above. The particular version used in this
handbook is MSC/NASTRAN Version 2013.1 but any software provider that offers a
version of the NASTRAN solver will have similar documentation available.

The pilot models used for this handbook are very similar to the original volume 1
models with the exception of addition output requests or output options specified in
the NASTRAN Case Control Section subcases.

The Executive and Case Control template for the ATS1 pilot model is illustrated in
<<fig5>>. The other models have additional subcases but each is structured as shown
with similar output requests. Requests that are not supported for a particular
element type are ignored. The target for each output request is the 'ALL' string
which indicates a request to output the quantity for all applicable nodes or elements.

NASTRAN uses a hierarchical technique to interpret certain output request options.
Output options specified for the first subcase STRESS output request are applied to
subsequent subcases and to similar output quantities such as STRAIN. Also, output
specified above the first subcase definition is applied to all subcases if not
overridden. A brief discussion of each of the listed cards is shown in <<table1>>.
Items in gray italics are solver specific control entries and are not currently
processed or mapped to any STEP entity.

The PRINT output option generates an ASCII output that is human readable and is
formatted for printing on a line printer. The file extension for this file is .f06
and also contains model statistics, summaries and diagnostics information. PUNCH
output is also ASCII but is a data-record formatted file that can easily be read by
humans or computers. The 'Item Codes' tables located in the NASTRAN Quick Reference
Guide define the data record formats for this file. Additional binary output files
(.op2, .xdb or .h5) can be requested that contain NASTRAN data blocks used in the
solution sequence. Reading a binary file is the preferred method to obtain result
data for all but trivial sized FEA models. For the pilot studies, several formats
are provided.

The sections that follow present how each quantity and option is implemented in the
AP209 ed2 data model for the categories of elements (curve, surface or volume) used
in the pilot studies.

=== AP209 ed2 Analysis Control Structures

The AP209 ed2 control structures represent the operations that are specified and
performed on the *fea_model_3d* entity. Also, they relate the analysis results to
the appropriate input controls. The basic control and result structure is presented
in the AP209 ed2 Recommended Practices document and is repeated here as <<fig6>>.

[[fig6]]
.Linear Static Analysis - Control Structures
image::img06.png[]

This document focuses on the shaded area which shows the top level relationship of
the control to the *fea_model* (superclass of *fea_model_3d*). The *fea_model* is
the top level entity for the definition of the FEA model mesh, physical properties
and material properties while the control structures define load cases, boundary
conditions, loads and links to results. Refer to Volume 1 for a discussion of the
*fea_model* and also the entities outside the shaded area.

Below the control entities in <<fig6>> are entities that are specializations of the
EXPRESS *analysis_step* class. These subclasses represent the FEA load case or
subcase concept. A new set of the *control_linear_static_analysis_step* entities
will be instantiated for each subcase. If no results are being mapped to AP209 ed2,
then only the *control_linear_static_analysis_step* and related entities will be
present. If only the model definition (mesh) without loads and boundary conditions
are being processed, then no control entity will be required.

<<fig7>> is the class inheritance diagram for the *analysis_step* subclasses
followed by the flattened EXPRESS schema definitions in <<fig8>>. Through the
inheritance mechanism, it shows how the full set of attributes for each subclass are
built up to support the control entity structure defined in <<fig6>>. Note that each
subclass references 'to' the top level control which forms a 'many-to-one'
relationship between the analysis steps and the top level control.

[[fig7]]
.Analysis_step Class Inheritance Diagram
image::img07.png[]

The *control_result_relationship* class definition is also included in <<fig8>>.
Instances of this class allow results steps to be associated to the appropriate
control steps. Note that this is a 'one-to-one' relationship necessitating a
separate instance for each combination of *control_analysis_step* and
*result_analysis_step*.

A basic understanding of the EXPRESS schema language for class and type definitions
was discussed in Volume 1 of this handbook and is not repeated. Again, the reader is
encouraged to review the AP209 ed2 standard and the Recommended Practices document
which discusses these entities in detail. Red text are the formal names and the blue
text highlights relevant attributes for review.

These schema definitions also contain attributes that refer to several other entity
classes. The *control_step* references a
*control_linear_static_load_increment_process*, which in turn, refers to a single
*state* entity through the *final_input_state* attribute. These *state* entities
function as top level collectors of all the information defining each subcase or
step. A brief definition of the collector state entities used in <<fig6>> is
presented in <<fig9>> along with an illustration of these states for a cantilevered
beam.

[[fig9]]
[cols=3]
.Interpretation of State Collectors for a Control_Step
|===
h| Initial input state | The initial values of the solution variables and related field variables (can be values from a prior step) a| [%unnumbered]
image::img-t5.png[]

h| Final input state | The boundary conditions and applied loads that are to be balanced by reaction forces and internal forces of the model to achieve static equilibrium a| [%unnumbered]

|===

These collector **state**(s) are referenced 'from' an analysis step or process
entity through a simple entity reference; therefore, there can only be a single
instance for each analysis step. In general, *state* entities and its subclasses can
be related to each other through use of *state_relationship* entities that have
attributes representing the *relating* and the *related* state entities. Through use
of these entities, complex hierarchical data structures can be constructed to
represent the collections of FEA information associated to a load step or subcase.
The *relating* state is the parent or aggregator while the *related* state is the
child or item being aggregated.

<<fig10>> is taken from the Recommended Practice document for AP209 ed2 to
illustrate use of the *state_relationships* in relating the top level collector
state and the lower level *specified_states* in a simple tree structure under the
process entities. *Specified_states* are a sub-class of the state class but have no
additional attributes and can be referenced by the *state_relationships*. This type
of sub-classing is used to distinguish instances of the specialized sub-class from
other entity classes that also inherit from the state super-class. Instances of
*specified_state* can be used for the top level aggregator.

[[fig10]]
.Simple Tree Structure of States

One concept that often causes confusion is the use of the terms 'initial' and
'final' in the context of the control inputs. Do not confuse 'initial' with the
applied loads or specified boundary conditions. 'Initial' refers to initial values
of solution variables known from a prior step while 'final' refers to the set of
inputs that are the specified part of the final set of solution variables at
equilibrium. Details of these control structures are presented in the next section.

[[cls-5.3]]
=== NASTRAN Case Control Specified as Analysis Steps

The AP209 ed2 control structures are used to capture the information specified in
the NASTRAN Case Control Section. Specifically, the subcase definitions in a NASTRAN
solver deck are mapped directly to *control_linear_static_analysis_step* and the
related process and state entities. These top level control, process and state
entities together provide attributes to capture the semantics of the subcase
information. Each of the diagrams presented in this handbook follows this aggregate
view of the subcase (step+process+state).

There is limited guidance in the recommended practice on how to capture identifiers
for this information; participants in the pilot study chose different mappings which
led to problems interpreting each other's STEP output as well as problems
identifying and visualizing the loads and boundary conditions for each subcase.
Specifically, for each *control* entity, the
*control_linear_static_analysis_step.step_id* must be populated with a unique
subcase identifier. In NASTRAN, this refers to the unique integer subcase id.
Additionally, the optional NASTRAN title, subtitle, and label for each subcase
should map to the description attributes for the step, process and top level state
instance. <<fig11>> illustrates guidance for identifying the subcase id and
highlights the aggregate view of an FEA subcase. The sequence attribute provides an
index for sorting the steps into the solver order and should be used for the
*step_id* when no other value is provided. The sequence attribute also has a
uniqueness requirement.

The pseudo listing shown in <<fig12>> illustrates where these attributes might
appear in a typical NASTRAN Case Control Section and notional values for each.

$ etc...
----

The *control_process.process_id* and the top level *specified_state.state_id* should
be populated with user defined identifiers that can include the
*analysis_step.step_id* for readability. These guidelines are reflected in the pilot
study STEP files that were used for developing this handbook. No additional guidance
is provided for the state relationship instances.
