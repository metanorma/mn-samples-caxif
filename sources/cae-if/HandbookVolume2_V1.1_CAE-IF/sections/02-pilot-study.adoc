== Pilot Study Overview

The pilot studies were created to encourage software providers to participate in
initial efforts to develop commercial tools capable of converting traditional FEA
information, expressed in solver ASCII format, to the AP209 ed2 format. A second
goal of the pilot studies was to produce a reference set of AP209 ed2 STEP files
that have been validated with the AP209 ed2 EXPRESS schema and have been checked for
semantics with respect to the Recommended Practices for AP 209 ed2 10303-209:2014
and the document, Geometric Founding and Associativity in ISO 10303-209, Rev. B,
2/15/2001. A longer term goal is to enable FEA pre and post processors to both read
and write AP209ed2 compliant data sets.

The pilot studies provide a small test suite of FEA models and solutions to be
translated from a native solver format, in this case NASTRAN, to the STEP AP209 ed2
ASCII file representation (Part 21). These models are prismatic beam models with
various linear element types, boundary conditions, load cases, and output requests.
The overall geometry for each model is the same and is simple (see <<fig1>>). This
simplicity was intentional to focus the effort on the interpretation of the FEM
definitions, constructs and results, not the geometric abstractions related to
meshing techniques.

Discretization of the geometry to the finite element model domain was accomplished
through the abstractions and resulting finite element models shown in <<fig2>>. The
finite element models were exported in NASTRAN bulk data format for use in this
pilot study. These models were solved using MSC/NASTRAN V2013.1.0 to generate the
requested results.

Volume 1 of this handbook discussed each pilot model in order and presented the same
topics in each sub-section. Where topics were identical (such as using a common
isotropic material for all models), a reference to the first occurrence of the topic
was presented. This allowed the discussion to focus on the new information unique to
each model.

Volume 2 of the handbook differs in how the material is presented to the reader.
First, the overall structure of solution controls is discussed, followed by the
details of the loads and boundary conditions. Examples from the pilot models are
presented to illustrate how the concepts apply to the different model abstractions.
Lastly, complete listings of the solver input, excerpts of the solver outputs, and
the STEP output are included in the Appendices.
