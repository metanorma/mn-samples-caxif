== Overall connectivity in top Assembly

TODO: SO FAR INCOMPLETE

STEP AP242 ed2 has two ways to express connectivity, either by AssemblyShapeJoint or
by PartConnectivityDefinition. How they differ and when to use which one:

* As the name indicates, an AssemblyShapeJoint can only be used for an
AssemblyDefinition (or subtype WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign) that contains
Occurrences (aka devices) that are connected with each other. This is done by
referencing the two or more OccurrenceShapeFeatures(or subtypes
OccurrenceContactFeature and OccurrenceTerminal) of these Occurrences

* An AssemblyShapeJoint is used for the representation With
AssemblyShapeJointItemRelationship two or more any kind of OccurrenceShapeFeatures
(e.g. OccurrenceTerminals) can be connected. This might be for pure mechanical
reasons (OccurrenceShapeFeatures or OccurrenceContactFeature), but can also be to
exchange energy or information (OccurrenceTerminal).
* A PartConnectivityDefinition can be used in different way
** for a part to tell which terminal are internally connected
** for an assemble to state which internal devices are connected
** for an assembly to state how the internal devices are connected by wires, cables,
harnesses ... / also covered by AssemblyShapeJoint
** for an assembly to state how the terminal of internal devices are made accessible
to the outside by terminals of the assembly

Some aircrafts (especially bigger ones) are build in sections with each having its
own wiring harness(es). E.g. separate sections for the cockpit, the front fuselage,
the central fuselage, the rear fuselage, the wings and the turbines. These sections
might be manufactured and assembled in different factories. Only in the final
assembly line these sections are combined into the final aircraft, and part of this
process is that the wiring harnesses in the separate sections are joined by
connecting corresponding plugs and receptacles from different harnesses. By this the
overall electrical system of an aircraft is set up. For each such join a single
AssemblyShapeJoint is needed for the purpose of data exchange.

When all the high level AssemblyShapeJoints between all the plugs and receptacles
for the top assembly of a vehicle are given, a receiving system can then deduce all
the lower level AssemblyShapeJoints and so generate the overall electrical network
of the whole top assembly.

Connectivity between all the devices (sensors, actors, computers, batteries, lamps,
...) in a top assembly.
