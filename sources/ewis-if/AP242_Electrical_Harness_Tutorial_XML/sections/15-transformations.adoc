== Transformations and Associations

There are different kinds of _RepresentationRelationship_ for different purposes. In
this clause we will compare the traditional ones for assembly structures of rigid
component with the ones used for flexible structures such as electrical wire harness

[[cls-15.1]]
=== Assembly structure of rigid components

In an assembly structure of rigid components a _NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage_ is used
to relate a _SingleOccurrence_ that is typically defined by a _PartView_ of a piece
part into another _PartView_ that is an _AssemblyDefinition_ of another Part that is
the assembly.

In such a situation both _PartViews_ may have the _DefiningGeometry_ attributes set.
The _PartView_ of the piece part typically refers to an _ExternalGeometricModel_
where all the details are defined. On the XML level only an _AxisPlacement_ for the
_Origin_ of the model is provided (typically at coordinates 0/0/0 with no rotation).
For the _PartView_ of the assembly however there is typically no external geometric
model available. Instead there is a _ComposedGeometricModel_ that is the composition
of all it's components with some transformation.

The geometric composition and transformation is defined by
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ that relates the
_ExternalGeometricModels_ of the piece parts into the _ComposedGeometricModel_ of
the assembly. The transformation is defined by a pair of _AxisPlacements_, one that
defines an _Origin_ for the _ExternalGeometricModel_ and one that defines the
_Target_ within the _ComposedGeometricModel_ where a "copy" of the
ExternalGeometricModel is virtually placed (this is done by a receiving system that
visualize a ComposedGeometricModel).

As a piece part might show up several times in an assembly through several
_SingleOccurrences_, it is essential to know which transformation applied for which
SingleInstance. For this purpose the Placement attribute of a
_NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage_ refers to the
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ for a given
_SingleOccurrence_ within the assembly.

[CAUTION,type=""]
====
A _GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ that is used as
described here must have the _Definitional_ attribute set to TRUE as the
_ExternalGeometricModel_ becomes a definitional piece of the
_ComposedGeometricModel_. There are other usages of
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ where the
Definitional attribute has to be set to FALSE; e.g. for a ToolPartRelationship
between the PartViews of a screw and a screw-driver.

=== Flexible topological and rigid 3D models of a Harness

The top object of an electrical wiring harness is a _Part_ with the
_PartCategoryEnum_ "wiring harness".

The specific associations needed to represent the design of an electrical wiring
harness are supported by _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ that is a specialization of
_AssemblyDefinition_ that is a _PartView_.

As explained in clause

TODO: xxx

the main geometric model of a WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign
is defined by an EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint that is
referenced by the attribute Topology. In addition the WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign
might have the attributes DefiningGeometry and AuxiliaryGeometry set to a 2D or 3D
GeometricModels that represent the final intended shape of the harness when
installed, or shape when the harness is delivered, or as manufactured on a foam
board. However it must be clear that all these GeometricModels represent only one of
of very many possible ones the wiring harness may have. Only when a wiring harness
is installed in a higher assembly (e.g. an aircraft or vehicle) a fixed 3D model can
be applied. But even for this case there might be variations, e.g. because part of a
harness may end in a door that can move relative to other parts of a harness that
are in the main part of the vehicle (see Kinematics capabilities of AP242). It is
also to mention that for maintenance purpose the 3D shape of a harness will change,
e.g. when opening a plug-socket connection.

For a full design documentation a _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ shall have an
associated topological model in the form of a
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ topology. The attribute
_Topology_ might not be set if the
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ is not available or if the
topology is too simple that it is not needed; e.g. in the case of a single cable with
two connectors at the ends.

Example taken from HarnessExample_Hierarchical.stpx:

The _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ "_311002" refers to the
__EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint__ "_321010" by the attribute
__Topology__ and to the __ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation__ "_314090"by the
attribute __DefiningGeometry__.

[[cls-15.3]]
=== Assembly structure of flexible components

For the purpose of electrical wiring harness with flexible components such as wires
and cables, two additional _RepresentationRelationships_ have been introduced,
_GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ and _TopologyToGeometryModelAssociation_. Both
can be used as well by the _Placement_ attribute of _NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage_,
but these new associations don't define a geometric transformation. Therefore the
inherited _Definitional_ attribute must be set to FALSE; the _Relating
Representation_ will not become part of the _Related_ one.

[[fig27]]
.RepresentationRelationships for Transformation and Association
image::img27.png[]

Only specific kinds of RepresentationItems that are allowed as Origin and Target for
_GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ and _TopologyToGeometryModelAssociation_.

* For the _Origin_ of a _GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ or the _Target_ of a
_TopologyToGeometryModelAssociation_ only the types _Edge_ (subtype
_EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength_ or _SubEdge_), _Path_ and _Vertex_ (subtype
_VertexPoint_) are allowed.
* For the _Target_ of a _GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ or the _Origin_ of a
_TopologyToGeometryModelAssociation_ only the types _AxisPlacement_,
_CartesianPoint_, _Curve_, _EdgeCurve_ or _VertexPoint_ are allowed.

[[cls-15.4]]
=== Associating Models of rigid and flexible Part to the topological Model of a Wire Harness Model

This clause focuses on the application object *GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation*
(G2TMAsso). It is used to associate the GeometricModels of occurrences of rigid and
flexible parts to the topological items of a
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ (EBTRepWLC) of a
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ (WHAD), see <<fig30>>. The structure and usage of a
G2TMAsso is very similar to a
*GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation* (GeoRepWPT) as they
are both subtypes of the main supertype *RepresentationRelationship*. They consists
of two pairs of associated objects. With the Related/Relating attributes the
_Representations_ are associated and with Origin/Target attributes the detailed
_RepresentationItems_ of these _Representations_ are associated.

[[fig29]]
.Transformation of a rigid part occurrences into an assembly
image::img29.png[]

The default pattern of how _Occurrences_ (Single or Quantified) are brought into an
_AssemblyDesign_ apply also for a WHAD. The _Single-_ and _QuantifiedOccurrences_
are brought into a WHAD through _NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsages_ (NAOU). With it's
attribute Placement, the NAOU is pointing to the corresponding G2TMAsso. This
structure is important as there may be several occurrences of the same PartView and
so it is possible to distinguish to association between these different occurrences.

The underlying _PartViews_ of the Occurrences must have an associated
_GeometryModel_. For a rigid Part/PartVersion/PartView such as a connector, the
GeometricModel is typically a placeholder for a 3D model that is available elsewhere
(e.g. an externally defined ABREP). This GeometricModel contains as minimum a single
AxisPlacement that typically represents the origin of the 3D
GeometricCoordinateSpace (at point 0/0/0 with no rotation). The G2TMAsso references
this AxisPlacement as its Origin attribute and with the Target attribute it refers
to a VertexPoint of the EBTRepWLC.

Unlike rigid components, cables and wires are typically flexible and are available
at arbitrary lengths with with a (semi-) constant cross-section. Because of this
cables and wires have typically no fixed 3D model. However they have typically a
constant cross-section, at least within some limits. This 2D geometric cross-section
is represented by a 2D GeometricModel. In most cases this GeometricModel contains no
details and so consists only of a single 2D AxisPlacement that represents the centre
(typically at point 0/0 with no rotation). Like with rigid parts the G2TMAsso
references this AxisPlacement with its Origin attribute, but with the Target
attribute the G2TMAsso refers to a *Path* of the EBTRepWLC. This Path with its
underlying *EdgeBoundedCurveWithLengths* (EdgeBCWL) defines the "Placement" of the
wire or cable occurrence within the topological model. In the case that a wire or
cable is not round and there is a need to represent the real geometric cross-section
this can be done by this 2D GeometricModel as well. For the XML representation this
has to be realized by using the subtype ExternalGeometricModel in 2D.

NOTE: To control to orientation of the flexible cable or wire in 3D it is possible
to define a second AxisPlacement that can then be used to be associated with the
directrix of a curve_swept_solid_shape_representation (see ISO 10303-523).

NOTE: This standard does not only support the geometric cross-section of e.g. cable
or wire, but also supports the topological cross-section structure of e.g. complex
cables or HarnessSegments with their inner structure, see <<cls-13>>.

[[fig30]]

[example]
====
The mapping of flexible objects such as wires, cables and tubular covers to the topological model is done as follows.

. A generic _GeometricModel_ (example _104890) is representing an unspecific 2D
cross-section for arbitrary __PartViews__ for wires, cables and others. A single
__RepresentationItem__ of type __AxisPlacement__ is defined for the centre of the
cross-section. This __AxisPlacement__ is later associated to a topological Path of the
topological harness representation and then further on to a curve in a 3D
GeometricModel.

=== Association of harness topology to Geometry Models

This clause focuses on the use of the application object
TopologyToGeometryModelAssociation. It is used to associate topological items from
the _EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ to corresponding
geometric representation items in an external geometric model.

TODO: ... pairwise ...

The geometric model of _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ is often represented as a
_CompositeGeometricModel_, that is composed of the flexible part of the harness
(harness segments) and the rigid parts such as connectors (at harness nodes). For
the representation of rigid parts and there geometries see the CAX-IF recommended
practises. For the structure of harness segments some CAX-Systems

other geometric representations; e.g. the ones for the representation of the
flexible harness segments and the ones for the rigid connectors. For the rigid
components such as connectors, their geometry is typically brought into the
_CompositeGeometrcModel_ by a
GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation. For the harness
segments some CAD system prefer to introduce an artificial product for which there
is no place in AP242, as there is no way to build or buy the harness segments
without all the rigid parts such as connectors (we can buy individual connectors,
but we typically can not buy harness segments). However even these system provide an
external geometric model that is used for the _CompositeGeometricModel_ of the
overall harness.

There is a ExternalGeometricModel that represents the centre-line curves for the for

====
For the external 2D or 3D representation of the centre line curves for the harness
segments it is best to use ExternalGeometricallyBoundedWireframeShapeRepresentation
or ExternalEdgeBasedWireframeShapeRepresentation for the 3D case on the XML level.
These correspond for the p21 level to
geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation or
edge_based_wireframe_shape_representation respectively. For the 2D case
geometrically_bounded_2d_wireframe_representation should be used on the p21 level
when available.
====

On the right side of <<fig31>> we see a placement transformation of a rigid part
into the harness assembly. The structure is identical to what is detailed in the
Recommended Practices for AP242 Business Object Model XML Assembly Structure. E.g.
the _PartView_ of a connector calls out an _ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_
as its _DefiningGeometry_. This representation is defined within a
_GeometricCoordinateSpace_ (Geo.Coor.Space) and contains an _AxisPlacement_ (usually
at the position 0/0/0 with no rotation) for placement purposes.

[[fig31]]
.Flexible (by length) and rigid (2D/3D) model association
image::img31.png[]

A _SingleOccurrence_ of the _PartView_ of the connector is brought into the
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ by a _NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage_. The
_DefiningGeometry_ of a _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ is represented by another
_GeometricCoordinateSpace_ that also contains several _AxisPlacements_ that are on
the positions and orientations on where to place the _SingleOccurrences_. A
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ (GeoRepWPT) brings
the ABREP of the connector into the _ComposedGeometricModel_ of the
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_. The transformation is defined by aligning two
_AxisPlacements_ onto each other. The _Placement_ attribute of the
_NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage_ refers to this GRRWPT. This is needed to be able to
distinguish the geometry of several occurrences of the same type.

On the left side of <<fig31>> we see the transformation of flexible parts such as
cables and wires into the wiring harness assembly that is different, but similar to
the one of a rigid part. As a first step the occurrence of a cable is transformed
onto a _Path_ or _Edge_ of the
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ that defines the _Topology_
of the _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ by a _GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_
(G2TAsso). Here the position of the _AxisPlacement_ represents the start of the
cable that is mapped onto the start _Vertex_ of the _Path_. The z-direction
(_Axis[3]_) of the _AxisPlacement_ represents the direction of the centreline of the
cable. As the target _Path_ and underlying _Edges_ have no particular geometry
defined yet, we only know that this direction refers to the direction of the first
_Edge_ of the _Path_ at the start _Vertex_.

At a next step the topological elements of the
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ are associated to items of
the _ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_ that defines one of possible many
representations of the wire harness. For this a _GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_
(T2GAMP) is used that allows a pair-wise transformation of the items of the
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ onto the items of a
_GeometricModel_. Usually _Edges_ and _Paths_ are transformed onto _Curves_ and
_Vertices_ onto _AxisPlacements_. The figure shows a single _Edge_ that is mapped
onto an external _Curve_ within the _ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_.

NOTE: In the provided example a _GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ is only used to
map _Edges_ and _Paths_ onto _Curves_. It could also be used to map _Vertices_ to
_AxisPlacement_. This possible alternative had not been chosen because traditional
3D STEP implementations are used to directly map the 3D model of the piece-parts to
the 3D model of the assembly.

. First we have to identify the STEP p21 file that contains the real Advanced
boundary representation of the complete H1 harness. This STEP file might be included
in the zip file that also contains the example XML file that is described here.

. Next we have to create placeholders for the content we expect to find in the
external p21 STEP file. For this we create a special RepresentationContext of type
GeometricCoordinateSpace that includes the relevant RepresentationItems (here 2
Curves and an AxisPlacement) and an ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation:

The _ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_ contains a
_GeometryToTopologyModelAssociation_ that maps two origen objects (a Vertex and an
Edge) of the _EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ onto
corresponding target objects (here _AxisPlacement_ and curve) of the complete H1
geometry.

There is also an _GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_
that maps the defining geometry the terminal lug (here a
ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation) to a corresponding position and orientation
in the H1 geometry.
