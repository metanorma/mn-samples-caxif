== Examples

This tutorial comes together with reference examples that had been worked out by the
electrical harness working group of the AP242 Edition 2 development team. The
examples are hand-crafted and do not represent any complete design. The intention of
the examples is to demonstrate how the different AP242 edition 2 extensions for
electrical harness design play together.

The examples are build up onto each other in a few variants to show the capabilities
of the standard. Central for the examples are the topological structure of wiring
harness H1 and a modular and configurable connector of type ARINC 600 that are widely
used in aerospace industry.

This file contains the wiring harness H1 in a hierarchical assembly to represent an
artificial assembly structure of the ARINC600 connector. In addition this file
contains a second wiring harness H2 that is combined with H1 in an upper level
assembly for the whole aircraft. The H1 harness is provided in two different
configurations for either a single connector phone1 or two terminal lugs (lug3, lug4).

This file contains three wiring harnesses, the sub-harnesses H1a and H1b that are
constituents of the overall harness H1.

=== Flexible structure of harness H1

The main harness topology in this example consists of five segments S1 to S5 that
connects six nodes N1 to N6. On the end-nodes N1, N2, N5 and N6 different kinds of
connectors and a terminal lugs are placed.

* Most wires and cables are connected to the ARINC600 connector at node N2 and go
through segment S2. These are two coax RG 58 cables (cable1, cable2), a speaker cable
(cable3), and a single wire (wire2).
* On the internal node N3 a splice is placed that is realizing a T connection between
3 wires (wire1, wire2, wire3).
* The terminal lug at node N1 is connected by a single wire arriving from segment S1.
As S1 contains only a single component no grouping is needed for this segment.
* The phone connector at node N5 is connected by a single speaker wire (cable3)
arriving through segment S4. As S4 contains only a single component no grouping is
needed for this segment.
* The DSUB connector at node N6 is connected by two coax cables (cable1, cable2) and
a wire (wire3). These three wires and cables are grouped together with lacing in
Segment S5.
* In segment S2 wire2 and cable3 are grouped by twisting around each other. The
result is then grouped together with cable1 and cable2 and covered by a shielding
braid that is connected to the GND of the backshell of the ARINC600 connector.
* Segment S3 contains the same arrangement of cables and wires as in segment S2, but
because of the splice at node N3, it contains wire3 instead of wire1.
* A path through the segments S2, S3 and S4 has been defined for the speaker wire
(cable 3)
* A path through the segments S2, S3 and S5 has been defined for the two coax cables
(cable1, cable2) and the alternative of wire1 respectively wire3

A more detailed sub-topology on the main topology is available through the sub-nodes
X1 to X7 that are placed on the main segments S2, S3 and S5. These sub-nodes divide
the main segments. Segment S2 is divided by X2 and X3 into S2-1, S2-2 and S2-3.
Segment S3 is divided in two alternative ways, S3-1 and S3-2 by X1 and S3-a and S3-B
by X4. No sub-segments have been defined for the sub-nodes X6 and X7 on S5 because
there had been no need for it. These detailed topology is used as follows:

* to define a path consisting of the segments S2-1 and S3-1 for a protective covering
(wrap1)
* to define a path consisting of the segments S2-2, S2-1 and S3-1 for a heatshrink
(heatshrink1)
* to split the overall harness H1 into two sub-harnesses H1.a and H1.b that different
design groups are responsible for
* to define fixing locations at nodes X6 and X7

=== Rigid parts for harness H1

NOTE: for the purpose of this document we use the term part for those things that we
can buy or build several times, while the term component is used for an occurrence of
a part within an assembly. An assembly may contain two components (more precisely
occurrences) of a part "X" that might be identified as X1 and X2.

Data exchange for electrical wire harness is often restricted to those rigid
components that are electrical relevant. All the other "auxiliary" mechanical parts
like screws are not part of the data exchange. However for a complete representation
of the design they are of course needed. It is up to the particular use case which
components are exchanged, and this can be indicated by the specified
ApplicationDomains (see <<cls-5.1>>).

.Composition of ARINC600 connector for H1
image::img03.png[]

For the Harness H1, the ARINC600 connector is composed of connector housing of shell
size 1, an electrified backshell, two dummy inserts for the A and B slot, and a 5W2
insert for the C slot. The 5W2 insert will hold simple contacts of #5, #12 and #16
size in the cavities 1 to 5.

The elements caa data exchange for electrical harness is often limited to

The electrical relevant components

[[cls-3.3]]
=== Connectivity of harness H1

[[cls-3.4]]
=== Flat assembly structure for harness H1

[[cls-3.5]]
=== Hierarchical assembly structure for Harness H1

[[cls-3.6]]
=== Harness H1 with assembly alternatives

Same as Example 3.1 and <<fig2>>, but now with alternative of lug3 & 4 instead of
phone 1.

One way to exchange overlapping alternative assemblies in STEP is to use a so called
150% structure. So the design of H1 contains all components, including phone1, lug3
and lug4. However a single 100% structure can only contain either phone1 or otherwise
lug3 and lug4. This is realised by the two ProductConfiguration "H1 stereo plug" and
H1 hookup lugs" for the same ProductConcept. With ConfiguredAssemblyEffectivity the
not used Occurrencess and PartShapeElements are excluded.

No further details of this specific use case is explained here, but the example
structures can be found in HarnessExample.xml file.

[[cls-3.7]]
=== Example Harness H1 designed by two teams as H1a and H1b

Same as Example 3.1 and <<fig1>>, but now split into an H1.a and a H1.b view,
developed by different teams.

For the exchange of such a scenario three different instances of
WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign are created, one for H1 with the
PredefinedApplicationDomainEnum value "complete_design" and two others for H1.a and
H1.b with the PredefinedApplicationDomainEnum value "partial_design". The partial
design views are related with the complete design by instances of
DefinitionalPartViewUsage. By this the complete design H1 is automatically defined
being the merger of H1a and H1b.

In the similar way there are three
EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint with the same
RepresentationContext, one for the complete Harness H1 and two others for the partial
harnesses H1a and H1b. They all share the same instance of Vertex X4, and so are
explicitly linked together.

No further details of this specific use case is explained here, but the example
structures can be found in HarnessExample_DesignSplitting.xml file.

[[cls-3.8]]
=== Higher Level Assembly with harness components H1 and H2

[example]
====
Aircraft with two harnesses

[[fig4]]
.Harnesses H1 and H2 combined in top assembly Aircraft99x
image::img04.png[]

The example also contains a second mini harness example Part_H2 and a top assembly
Aircraft99x (<<fig4>>). The mini harness example Part_H2 consists only of a single
wire (wire4) and a terminal lug (lug2) to which one end of the wire is connected to.
The other end of the wire is intended to be connected to the arinc1 connector from
the Part_H1 example above, but this connector is not part of the H2 assembly. This
situation is in some industries called "poke-home".

The top assembly Aircraft99x that contains 3 Occurrences:

* h1.1 that is of type Part_H1
* h2.1 that is of type Part_H2
* battery1 that is connected with the interface terminals of the two terminal lugs

The PLUS and MINUS terminals of the battery is connected to the interface terminals
of the two terminal lugs (lug1 and lug2).

Also the "poke-home" connection from the H2 assembly can finally be connected in that
top assembly because arinc1 from Part_H1 and wire4 from Part_H2 are available in this
assembly.

In the following clauses this example is further detailed.
