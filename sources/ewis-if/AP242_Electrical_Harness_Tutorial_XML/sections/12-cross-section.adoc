== Cross Section of Cables or Harness Segments

When cutting through a harness segment perpendicular to its centre line we will see
cables, wires, and other auxiliary materials such as isolations, shields,
protections and more. The following data model is provided to describe such a
structure.

The data model defines a directed acyclic graph, with
CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElements as the leave elements that are defined by
CrossSectionalPartShapeElements. The higher level nodes and root nodes in this graph
are:

* CrossSectionalAlternativePartShapeElement
* TwistedCrossSectionalGroupShapeElement
* CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement
* TwistedCrossSectionalGroupShapeElement
* CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithTubularCover
* CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithLacing

The cross-section of a HarnessSegment can be defined by any ones of these nodes.
However the definition of any of these nodes and leaves is not restricted to a
single HarnessSegment. These nodes may span several segments and are therefore
defined and reusable for the whole harness.

A CrossSectionalPartShapeElement, subtype of PartShapeElement represents an extruded
shape along some centre-line of a part. The minimum bend radius for this shape (to
the centre-line) as well as the minimal and maximal cross sectional diameter of the
shape is provided. The exact geometry of the cross sectional ShapeElement (e.g.
circular or rounded rectangle) is not specified as this may vary along the centre
line. The boolean attribute Outer specifies if TRUE the outer shape along the centre
line. If FALSE an inner shape is provided. A PartView can have at most one
CrossSectionalPartShapeElement with value TRUE for Outer, but it may have zero, one
or more CrossSectionalPartShapeElements with the value FALSE.

A CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElement is an OccurrenceShapeElement defined by a
CrossSectionalPartShapeElement for an Occurrence of a Part.
CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElements are the leave elements from which the cross
section of a harness segment is build up.

A CrossSectionalConstituentElementSelect defines a select of either a
CrossSectionalPartShapeElement or a CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElement.

A CrossSectionalAlternativePartShapeElement is a CrossSectionalPartShapeElement that
defines that one of two or more CrossSectionalConstituentElementSelects is to be
used as alternatives in a cross section.

A CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement is a CrossSectionalPartShapeElement that groups
one or more items defined by CrossSectionalConstituentElementSelect. How the
grouping is realised is not defined.

A TwistedCrossSectionalGroupShapeElement is a CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement where
the items are grouped by twisting. The twist direction and period can be specified.

A CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithTubularCover is a
CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement where the items are grouped by covering them all
around with a specified side of material from a specific side of this material.

CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithLacing is a CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement where
the items are laced together by some material. The details of lacing such as the
period length are not specified.

Explanation of the cross sectional structure in the provided example:

* for the wire, coax cable RG 48, and the Speaker Cable no detailed information is
provided about the inner structure, insulation etc. So only the *outer*
CrossSectionalPartShapeElement is provided for these parts, together with
corresponding CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElements for the Occurrences. See the
upper part of <<table1>>
* for the Braid, Wrap and HeatShrink the *inner* CrossSectionalPartShapeElement and
corresponding CrossSectionalOccurrenceShapeElement is needed as they need to go over
something else. See the lower part of <<table1>>.
* wire2 in segment S2 is equivalent to wire3 in segment S3; so these are taken as
alternatives for a AlternativeLongitudinalExtendPart (_31300)
* the alternative of wire2 and wire3 are twisted with cable3, covered by
TwistedCrossSectionalGroupShapeElement (_313002). The twist-direction is clockwise
and the length of the period is 5 cm.
* the result of the upper twist is together with cable1 and cable2 grouped together
and covered by braid1 for shielding purpose by
CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithTubularCover (_313004).
* the group covered by braid1 is protected by wrap1 through
CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithTubularCover (_313005).
* the group protected by wrap1 is further protected by heatshrink1 through
CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithTubularCover _313006
* in some places (S2-2) the heatshrink1 is directly on braid1,
CrossSectionalGroupShapeElementWithLacing (_313008).

In <<table4>> and <<table5>> the details of the cross sectional structure used in H1
are provided.
