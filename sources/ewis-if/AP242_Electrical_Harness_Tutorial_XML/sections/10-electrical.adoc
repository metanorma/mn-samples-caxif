== Electrical Connectivity & AssemblyShapeJoint

The electrical connectivity in AP242 follows the so called "CFI five-box model of
electrical connectivity", defined originally by the CAD Framework Initiative (CFI),
see +
http://www10.edacafe.com/book/ASIC/CH09/CH09.5.php

The CFI model is used in AP242 for both, functional and physical connectivity. As
this tutorial focuses on the physical design aspects of an electrical harness, only
the physical connectivity aspects are presented here.

All terminal, connectivity and many other geometrically related aspects in AP242 are
realised by specializations of the generic ShapeElement and ShapeFeatureDefinition
objects.

[[cls-10.1]]
=== Adopted CFI Five-Box Model for Electrical Connectivity

Adopting the CFI five-box model to the modelling style and terminology used in
AP242-XML and applying several simplifications the model would looks like this:

[[fig10]]
.Simplified adopted CFI five-box model for physical connectivity
image::img10.png[]

* A _PartView_ represents any kind of a physical design and all the underlying parts
it is made of. So the design of an electrical harness is a part and also all the
connectors, cables and other things it is made of are represented as _PartViews_.
* A _PartTerminal_ represents some area of a PartView where it can be electrical or
optical connected; e.g. one of the inside or outside terminals of a connector. +
A _PartTerminal_ belongs to exactly one _PartView_. +
A _PartView_ may have zero, one or many _PartTerminals_
* An _Occurrence_ is a particular usage of a _PartView_ and is therefore defined by
one _PartView_. +
A _PartView_ may serve as the definition for many _Occurrences_. +
A higher level _PartView_ may "contain" _Occurrences_ of lower level _PartViews_ In
STEP the subtype AssemblyView is to be used in this case. The structure is recursive
and so also occurrences of higher level PartView can be constructed that may be
contained in an even higher level PartView and so on. PartViews and Occurrences form
a Direct Acyclic Graph, so a PartView can not contain Occurrences of itself.
+
--
[example]
An electrical harness PartView that contains two Occurrences of a connector.

NOTE: This simplified model assumes that an Occurrence is ues in exactly one
Part/AssemblyView.

In STEP an Occurrence can be used in zero, one or many Part/AssemblyViews.
--
* An OccurrenceTerminal represents some area of an Occurrence where it can be
connected. +
An OccurrenceTerminal belongs to exactly one Occurrence. +
An Occurrence can have zero, one or many OccurrenceTerminals +
An OccurrenceTerminal is defined by one PartTerminal from which it inherits all
characteristics. +
A PartTerminal may serve as the definition for many OccurrenceTerminals.
* A PartConnectivityDefinition represents a node of one or several electrical
connected elements. It is equivalent to the concept of a Kirchhoff node. +
A PartConnectivityDefinition belongs to one PartView. +
A PartView may have zero, one or many PartConnectivityDefinitions, +
A PartConnectivityDefinition connects two or more PartTerminals or
OccurrenceTerminals. In the case of PartTerminals they must be elements of the same
PartView. On the case of OccurrenceTerminals they must be elements of Occurrences
that are assembly components of the PartView. Consequently the subtype AssemblyView
is to be used. So in both cases the connected terminals are in the direct scope of
the Part or AssemblyView. +
An OccurrenceTerminal can be used by at most one PhysicalNode for the same PartView.

The following clauses explain in detail how the simplified CFI model is realised in
AP242.

[[cls-10.2]]
=== Adopted CFI Five-Box Model for any Joints in an Assembly

AP242 also contains a variation of the CFI five-box model to represent any kind of
mechanical connectivity in an assembly (<<fig11>>). This is based on the entities
_PartShapeElement_ and _OccurrenceShapeElement_ that are supertypes of
_PartTerminal_ respectively _OccurrenceTerminal_. An _AssemblyShapeJoint_ is itself
a _PartShapeElement_ and this belongs to a _PartView_ that is an assembly. An
_AssemblyShapeJoint_ connects typically two or more _OccurrenceShapeElements_
through _AssemblyShapeJointItemRelationships_. So an _AssemblyShapeJoint_ plays a
similar role as a _PartConnectivityDefinition_ but is not restricted to
ShapeElements that are terminals.

[[fig11]]
.AssemblyShapeJoint, on Occurrence/Part Contact Features
image::img11.png[]

<<fig12>> shows an example of the CFI 5 box model for an assembly of two occurrences
of a part with 2 terminals.

* top: PartView A with two PartTerminals A1 and A2
* middle: Aa and Ab of PartView A. Each has two OccurrenceTerminals that are defined
by the PartTerminals of PartView A. +
Occurrence Aa has the OccurrenceTerminals Aa1 and Aa2. +
Occurrence Ab has the OccurrenceTerminals Ab1 and Ab2.
* bottom: AssemblyView B with two AssemblyShapeJoints. +
AssemblyShapeJoint Bx joints the OccurrenceTerminals Ab1 with Aa2. +
AssemblyShapeJoint By joints the OccurrenceTerminals Ab2 with Aa1.

OccurrenceTerminals are essential to exactly specific which terminals are connected
or joined together. The same is true for the more generic supertype
OccurrenceShapeElement.

=== Detailed ShapeElement and AssemblyShapeJoint Model

This clause explains in detail how two _OccurrenceTerminals_ within an assembly are
joined together, e.g. an end of a wire with an "internal" terminal of a connector,
or two "external" terminals of two connectors.

While in the previous clauses we showed pieces of the AP242 connectivity model in a
rather simplified way to highlight the principles, we will now look to it in more
detail.

As stated earlier _OccurrenceShapeElement_ and _PartShapeElement_ are both subtypes
of _ShapeElement_. A _PartShapeElement_ represents an element of the shape of a
_PartView_, while an _OccurrenceShapeElement_ represents an element of the shape of
an _Occurrence_. To enforce this the _ElementOf_ attribute of a _PartShapeElement_
must call out a _PartView_, while the _ElementOf_ attribute of an
_OccurrenceShapeElement_ must call out an _Occurrence_.

NOTE: ElementOf of a ShapeElement might also refer to an AssemblyViewRelationship,
BreakdownElementView or IndividualPartView, but these cases are not addressed in
this tutorial.

An _OccurrenceShapeElement_ calls out as its _Definition_ a
_PartOrOccurrenceShapeElementSelect_ that is either a _PartShapeElement_ or an
_OccurrenceShapeElement_. There is a constraint on the combination of the values for
_ElementOf_ and _Definition_. If and only if _ElementOf_ has a value of type
_SpecifiedOccurrence_ the _Definition_ attribute must have a value of type
_OccurrenceShapeElement_.

An _AssemblyShapeJoint_ is a _PartShapeElement_ that belongs to an
_AssemblyDefinition_. An _AssemblyShapeJoint_ connects typically two or more
_OccurrenceShapeElements_. In most cases the _OccurrenceShapeElements_ belong to
different _Occurrences_ but there are special cases where some of them may be from
the same _Occurrence_. These _Occurrences_ must be related into the same
_AssemblyDefinition_ as the one the _AssemblyShapeJoint_ belongs to.

[[fig13]]
.Detailed AssemblyShapeJoint model
image::img13.png[]

For each _AssemblyShapeJoint_ the kind of joint can be specified. The following
_JointTypes_ are pre-defined:

* *welded connection* [IEV ref 581-23-06]: connection made by welding
* *soldered connection* [IEV ref 581-23-04]: connection made by soldering
* *glued connection*: connection made by glueing
* *snap connection*: connection made by snapping
* *push connection*: connection made by pushing
* *screwed connection*: connection made by screwing
* *bolted connection* [IEV ref 461-19-05]: connection in which the pressure to the
conductor is applied by bolting
* *wrapped connection* [IEV ref 581-23-07]: solderless connection achieved by
wrapping a solid conductor around a wrap post
* *insulation displacement connection* [IEV ref 581-23-35]: solderless connection
made by inserting a single wire into a slot in an insulation displacement termination
* *insulation piercing connection* [IEV ref 461-19-06]: connection made by metallic
protrusions which pierce the insulation of the cable core
* *crimped connection* [IEV ref 461-19-01] permanent connection made by the
application of pressure inducing the deformation or reshaping of the barrel around
the conductor of a cable
+
--
NOTE: In some cases, the deformation or reshaping of the barrel may affect the form
of the conductor.
--
* *circular compressed crimped connection* [IEV ref 461-19-02]: crimp connection in
which the barrel is compressed maintaining essentially its circular form
* *hexagonal compressed crimped connection* [IEV ref 461-19-03]: crimp connection in
which the barrel is compressed and reshaped essentially to a hexagonal form
* *deep indented crimped connection* [IEV ref 461-19-04]: crimp connection in which
the barrel and the cable conductor are deformed by deep indentations
* *promissory connection*: connection that is promised or expected to be established
in some way, but that is by purpose not realised for this PartView
* *promissory connection for higher assembly*: promissory connection that will be
realised in a higher assembly in which this assembly is an Occurrence
* *promissory connection for installation constraints*: the connection can not be
realised on this assembly level because of installation constraints and this must be
realised in a higher assembly
* *promissory connection for missing contributors*: the connection can not be
realised on this assembly level because one or more needed OccurrenceShapeElements
are not part of this assembly. So the final AssemblyShapeJoint can only be realised
in a higher assembly where the other OccurrenceShapeElements become accessible.

The attribute _JointType_ is optional; it should only be provided if available in
the sending system. Also _JointType_ does not need to be specified if one of the
underlying _JointTypes_ of the affected _PartTerminals_ that are called out as
_Definition_ of the _OccurrenceTerminal_ are already specific enough.

However if both, the _JointType_ of the _AssemblyShapeJoint_ and the JointType of
one or more _PartTerminals_ are provided, then the _JointTypes_ of the
_AssemblyShapeJoint_ overrides the _JointTypes_ of the _PartTerminal(s)_. E.g. if
the JointType of the PartTerminal type is a _crimp terminal_, and it used by an
_AssemblyShapeJoint_ with type _solder_, then this means the joint is realised by
soldering, not by crimping.

TODO: add example code

AssemblyShapeJoint provides the capability to directly connect two or more
terminals. However in some special cases it might be needed to provide a
hierarchical structure of how the joints are realized. Example of such a situation
with two _AssemblyShapeJoints_ for joining three _OccurrenceTerminals_ (<<fig14>>).
First the ends of two wires (wire1 and wire2) are twisted together with a lower
level _AssemblyShapeJoint_, and then a higher level _AssemblyShapeJoint_ is taking
the twisted pair and connects it with an _OccurrenceTerminal_ from a splice1 by
crimping.

=== Detailed PartTerminal Model

This clause explains in detail the concept of _PartTerminal_ that identifies a
feature of a part that can be connected with others either electrical or optical.

[[fig15]]
.Detailed PartTerminal model
image::img15.png[]

A PartTerminal carries three additional attributes in addition to those it inherits
from PartShapeElement:

JointType characterises the intended way on how to contact the PartTerminal. Most of
the allowed values listed below are taken from IEC definitions. To achieve a
systematic naming convention the word "contact" has been replaced by the word
"terminal" or the word "terminal" has been added at the end. The terms written in
bold characters shall be used. Alternative IEC terms are separated by comma.

* *socket terminal*, socket contact, female contact [IEV ref 151-12-17]: contact
member intended to make electric engagement on its inner surface for mating with the
outer surface of another contact member

--
NOTE: In English, the term "socket contact" does not imply that socket contacts are
always mounted in a socket nor that sockets have only socket contacts.
--
* *pin terminal*, pin contact, male contact [IEV ref 151-12-18]: contact member
intended to make electric engagement on its outer surface for mating with the inner
surface of another contact member

clamped under the head of one or more screws, and where the clamping pressure can be
applied directly by the head of the screw or through an intermediate part, such as a
washer, clamping plate or an anti-spread device
* *mantle terminal* [IEV ref 442-06-14]: a terminal, in which the conductor is
clamped against the base of a slot in a threaded stud by means of a nut, by a
suitably shaped washer under the nut, by a central peg if the nut is a cap nut, or
by an equally effective means for transmitting the pressure from the nut to the
conductor within the slot
* *saddle terminal* [IEV ref 442-06-09]: a terminal, in which the conductor is
clamped against the base of a slot in a threaded stud by means of a nut, by a
suitably shaped washer under the nut, by a central peg if the nut is a cap nut, or
by an equally effective means for transmitting the pressure from the nut to the
conductor within the slot
* *pillar terminal* [IEV ref 442-06-22]: a screw type terminal, in which the
conductor(s) is (are) inserted into a hole or cavity, where it is clamped under the
shank of the screw
+
--
NOTE: The clamping pressure can be applied directly by the shank of the screw or
through an intermediate part, to which pressure is applied by the shank of the screw.
--
* *stud terminal* [IEV ref 442-06-23]: a screw-type terminal in which the conductor
is clamped under a nut
+
--
NOTE: The clamping pressure can be applied directly by a suitably shaped nut or
through an intermediate part, such as a washer, a clamping plate or an anti-spread
device.

* *snap on contact terminal* [IEV ref 581-22-10]: push-on contact in which retention
is achieved by means of a deformation of the contact area which provides positive
axial location

shape similar to that of a tuning fork, the two arms of which apply contact force in
opposite directions
* *push on contact terminal* [IEV ref 581-27-04]: contact with which a connection is
achieved by axial force, separation being restricted by friction
* *insulation displacement terminal*, insulation displacement termination [IEV ref

DomainType: Either electrical or optical. In principle also the domain types thermal
or magnetic are available, but these are not used in practise so far.

InterfaceOrJoinTerminal: This indicates on whether a PartTerminal is intended to be
connected on the next higher assembly level (e.g. the internal terminals of a
connector) or whether the PartTerminals are intended to be used to "interface" on an
even higher assembly level (e.g. the external terminals of a connector)

=== Detailed OccurrenceTerminal and PhysicalNode Model

This clause explains in detail how "components" of an electrical assembly are
connected with each other, either by AssemblyShapeJoints or by
_PartConnectivityDefinition_ that represents nodes in the sense of the Kirchhoff's
laws on electrical circuits.

For the exchange of electrical or optical connectivity information, _PartTerminal_,
subtype of _PartShapeElement_, and _OccurrenceTerminal_, subtype of
_OccurrenceShapeElement_, are to be used. The _Definition_ attribute of
_OccurrenceTerminal_ is of type _PartOrOccurrenceTerminalSelect_ which is either a
_PartTerminal_ or another _OccurrenceTerminal_. Similar to _OccurrenceShapeElement_,
the _Definition_ of _OccurrenceTerminal_ shall only, and only if, be of type
_OccurrenceTerminal_ when _ElementOf_ has a value of type _SpecifiedOccurrence_.

[[fig16]]
.PhysicalNode & OccurrenceTerminal
image::img16.png[]

Like _AssemblyShapeJoint_, _PartConnectivityDefinition_, is also a subtype of
_PartShapeElement_. It defines in a more generic way either electrical or optical
connection between several terminals without providing all the details. This is done
through the attribute _ConnectedTerminals_ that is of type
_PartOrOccurrenceShapeElement_. The following constraints apply:

* If a member of the _ConnectedTerminals_ is of type _PartTerminal_, then this
_PartTerminal_ shall belong to the same _PartView_ to which also
_PartConnectivityDefinition_ belongs to
* If a member of the _ConnectedTerminals_ is of type _OccurrenceTerminal_, then the
_Occurrence_ this _OccurrenceTerminal_ belongs to shall be related into an
_AssemblyDefinition_ via a _AssemblyOccurrenceRelationship_ that is also the same
_AssemblyDefinition_ the _PhysicalNode_ belongs to.

=== Referencing Terminals in Hierarchical Assembly Structures

So far we explained only on how to use _AssemblyShapeJoints_ and
_PartConnectivityDefinitions_ within a single assembly level as these concepts can
refer only to _OccurrenceShapeElements_ respectively _OccurrenceTerminals_ within
the same assembly level. But what to do when the _AssemblyShapeJoints_ and
_PartConnectivityDefinitions_ need to span over a multi level assembly structure?

The answer is to use _SpecifiedOccurrence_ to make
_OccurrenceShapeElements/OccurrenceTerminals_ from a lower assembly level visible on
a higher assembly level.

A _SpecifiedOccurrence_ has as its _Definition_ another _Occurrence_ (or subtype
_SpecifiedOccurrence_) and calls out with its attribute _UpperUsage_ a higher level
_Occurrence_, and thus making the lower level _Occurrence_ visible in the higher
level _Occurrence_. In a similar way the _OccurrenceShapeElements_ and
_OccurrenceTerminals_ from the lower level _Occurrence_ can be reflected for the
higher level _Occurrence_ by creating copies of _OccurrenceShapeElements_ and
_OccurrenceTerminals_ that refer with their _Definition_ attributes to the lower
level _OccurrenceShapeElements_ and _OccurrenceTerminals_.

Here an example on how this mechanism works through an assembly hierarchy with four
levels:

* The top assembly "Aircraft99x" contains an occurrence "h1.1" that is a "Part_H1"
* The assembly "Part_H1" contains an occurrence "arinc1" that is a "ARINC 600 set"
* The assembly "ARINC 600 set" contains an occurrence "C-Assy" for the insert at
position C that is a "5W2 assy"
* The assembly "5W2 assy" contains an occurrence "power3" that is a "#16 Rack plug
power contact"

A series of SpecifiedOccurrences flatten this hierarchical assembly structure:

* "h1.1/arinc1" represents the "arinc1" occurrence for the higher occurrence "h1.1"
* "arinc1/C-Assy" represents the "A-Assy" occurrence for the higher occurrence
"arinc1"
* "h1.1/arinc1/C-Assy" represents the "arinc1/A-Assy" occurrence for the higher
occurrence "arinc1/C-Assy"
* "C-Assy/power3" represents the "power3" occurrence for the higher occurrence
"C-Assy"
* "arinc1/C-Assy/power3" represents the "C-Assy/power3" occurrence for the higher
occurrence "arinc1"
* "h1.1/arinc1/C-Assy/power3" represents the "arinc1/C-Assy/power3" occurrence for
the higher occurrence "h1.1"

[[fig17]]
.SpecifiedOccurrence Tree with OccurrenceTerminals
image::img17.png[]

Now the terminal "jt" is made visible on the top assembly level and it can there be
connected by an AssemblyShapeJoint to another terminal "h2.1/wire1/end-a" for which
a similar structure will be build up.

Please note that the flattening of the hierarchical structure into a flat structure
is essential because:

* the "5W2 assy" might contain another occurrence "power4" of an "#16 Rack plug
power contact" (which is the case in our example)
* the "ARINC 600 set" might contain another occurrence "D-Assy" of an "5W2 assy"
* the "Part_H1" might contain another occurrence "arinc2" of an "ARINC 600 set"
* the " Aircraft99x" might contain another example "h1.2" of an "Part_H1"

If all this would be the case, an AssemblyShapeJoint on the top assembly level would
need to be specific as to which one of the following "jt" OccurrenceTerminals a
connection is made:

* "h1.1/arinc1/C-Assy/power3"
* "h1.1/arinc1/C-Assy/power4"
* "h1.1/arinc1/D-Assy/power3"
* "h1.1/arinc1/D-Assy/power4"
* "h1.1/arinc2/C-Assy/power3"
* "h1.1/arinc2/C-Assy/power4"
* "h1.1/arinc2/D-Assy/power3"
* "h1.1/arinc2/D-Assy/power4"
* "h1.2/arinc1/C-Assy/power3"
* "h1.2/arinc1/C-Assy/power4"
* "h1.2/arinc1/D-Assy/power3"
* "h1.2/arinc1/D-Assy/power4"
* "h1.2/arinc2/C-Assy/power3"
* "h1.2/arinc2/C-Assy/power4"
* "h1.2/arinc2/D-Assy/power3"
* "h1.2/arinc2/D-Assy/power4"

=== Flat Assembly Structure with geometrically constrained Occurrences

TODO: xx TBD, see HarnessExample_flat.xml

Some connectors have a quite complex assembly structure consisting of contacts,
inserts, housing, back-shell etc. Instead of using hierarchical assemblies some
system uses a flat assembly structure where these components all show up directly in
the main WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign. Having several connectors there is a need to
know which connector components belong together. This information can be provided by
either a pure mechanical AssemblyShapeJoint or AssemblyShapeConstraint. The
difference between these two concepts is that an AssemblyShapeJoint provides some
information on how the joined components hold together (e.g. by soldering) while an
AssemblyShapeConstraint only provides the information that some objects should
geometrically touch in some way, but without saying how this is achieved.

[[cls-10.8]]
=== Multi terminal connections

A coax cable and connectors typically often of a single shield and single
wire/contact. For practical reason only a single connection is used for data
exchange, and sender and receiver will understand that it is in fact 2 connections.
Other examples are e.g.

* power connection, consisting of phase, neutral and GND
* USB-C connection with 24 contacts in 12 pairs
* ethernet connections consisting of 4 twisted cable pairs, so 8 connections

Here a detailed example for a coax cable of type RG-58 (50 Ohms) and a corresponding
male and female connector
