== Representation & Geometry Models

<<fig22>> shows the data model for _Representation_ with subtypes
_GeometricRepresentation_ and _-Model_ and relationships between them, including
transformations and associations. A Representation is a collection of
RepresentationItems for which many subtypes are defined (e.g. _AxisPlacement_,
_Curve_, _CartesianPoint_, _Edge_, _Vertex_, _Path_ ...). _RepresentationItems_ are
defined within a _RepresentationContext_ and can therefore be used by the
_Representations_ of the same context. A _RepresentationItem_ is included in a
_Representation_ either directly (via the _Items_ attribute or indirectly because it
it referenced by another _RepresentationItem_. E.g. when a _Representation_ contains
an _Edge_, it also contains the two _Vertices_ called out by its _EdgeStart_ and
_EdgeEnd_ attribute. In this tutorial we only explain the representation
specializations that are needed for electrical harness.

_GeometricCoordinateSystem_ is a subtype of _RepresentationContext_ that defines a
geometric coordinate system in which CartesianPoints, Vectors and others can be
defined. The attribute _DimensionCount_ of _GeometricCoordinateSystem_ defines the
number of axis of the coordinate system which is typically 2 for 2D or 3 for 3D.
Further down we see a special case where a 1D coordinate system is used.

_GeometricRepresentation_, a subtype of Representation, requires the use of a
_GeometricCoordinateSystem_. It is further subtyped to _GeometricModel_ that might
be used as the _DefiningGeometry_ of a _PartView_. A _GeometricModel_ might be an
_ExternalGeometricModel_ that is available as a separate file; e.g. a STEP-p21 file.

A pair of _Representations_ from either the same or different contexts can be
related to each other by _RepresentationRelationship_. If the _Definitional_
attribute is set to TRUE, the _Related Representation_ becomes a definitional part
of the _Relating Representation_. Note that the _Relating_ attribute is covered as
containment for the XML exchange.

Geometrically defined transformations between two _GeometricRepresenations_ are
defined by subtypes of _GeometricRepresentationRelationship_:

* most widely used in STEP is
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithPlacementTransformation_ where the
transformation is indirectly defined by placing an _AxisPlacement_ from the related
_Representation_ (attribute _Origin_) onto an _AxisPlacement_ (attribute _Target_)
of the relating _Representation_.
* when scaling or mirroring is needed a
GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithCartesianTransformation is to be used

Relations between _GeometricRepresentations_ of the same _GeometricCoordinateSpace_
typically don't allow any transformations and so the
_GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithSameCoordinateSpace_ is to be used.

For a general introduction and usage guide of these concepts see the "Recommended
Practices for AP242 Business Object Model XML Assembly Structure". That document
provides several alternatives on how to do assemblies with transformation. For the
purpose of EWH it is recommended to use the method as explained in clause "7.3.2.1
Implicit Transformation". When using the method as described in clause '7.3.1
Template "Simplified Positioning Representation"' it won't be possible to link a 2D
or 3D geometric representation with the topological representation of an EWH.

[[cls-14.1]]
=== Harness Topology Representation

The topological structure of an electrical wire harness, is primarily build up from
the root topological elements _Vertex_ and _Edge_. An _Edge_ defines a directed link
between two _Vertices_, a _Start_ and an _End-Vertex_. For the purpose to represent
the topology structure of an electrical wire harness, a _Vertex_ is associated to a
geometric _Point_ and an _Edge_ is associated to a _Curve_. Because of this the
subtypes _VertexPoint_ and _EdgeCurve_ or _SubEdge_ are to be used.

In most traditional STEP geometric models the subtype _CartesianPoint_ for a _Point_
and any of the subtypes of _Curve_ such as a straight line are used, so that the
points and curves are fully located and described within a geometric coordinate
space, either 2D or 3D. However an electrical wire harness is typically flexible and
has no fixed geometric appearance. Because of this a 2D or 3D geometric coordinate
space is meaningless to describe the flexible nature of a harness. The above
mentioned subtypes _CartesianPoint_, straight line and others can not be used as
there are no fixed coordinates or directions.

Because of this only the supertype _Point_ or the subtype _PointOnCurve_ are to be
used for the attribute _VertexGeometry_ of _VertexPoints_. For _EdgeCurves_ only the
subtype _BoundedCurveWithLength_ is to be used for attribute _BasicCurve_. A
_BoundedCurveWithLength_ is a curve with a fixed length that is parametrised from 0
to the length of the curve. When _PointOnCurve_ is used, then the underlying curve
must be a _BoundedCurveWithLength_. For the purpose to define proper rules to ensure
these constraint the subtype _EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength_ has been introduced. When
a SubEdge is used, the ParentEdge must either be another SubEdge (a "bigger" one) or
an _EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength_..

[CAUTION,type=""]
====
When using geometric entities such as _Point_ or _Curve_ within a _Representation_
the use of a _RepresentationContext_ that is a _GeometricCoordinateSpace_ is
enforced (see also ISO 10303-42). A _GeometricCoordinateSpace_ requires the
specification of a _DimensionCount_ that is typically 2D or 3D. However as explained
above a 2D or 3D coordinate space is not suitable to describe the flexible nature of
a harness. It is therefore recommended to use for the _DimensionCount_ the value 1
to ensure that it is not meant to be 2D or 3D. However the value 1 does not means
that a harness is defined in a one dimensional coordinate space (even if a single
_BoundedCurveWithLength_ might suggest there is one dimension, think about what
happens if there are several independent _BoundedCurveWithLength_).
====

The _EdgeBoundedCurveWithLengths_ are grouped within a ConnectedEdgeSet that ensures
that all edges are somehow connected by sharing a common VertexPoint. Such a
ConnectedEdgeSet is the main RepresentationItem of an
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_, the specialized
Representation for the topological structure of WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign.

An _EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ must contain exactly one
ConnectedEdgeSet. Other Items of an
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ can be Path and
VertexPoint. They are constraint in the following way:

* the attribute VertexGeometry of the additional VertexPoints must refer to a
PointOnCurve that has a its BasicCurves one of the _BoundedCurveWithLength of the
EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength used in the_ ConnectedEdgeSet or by one of the Paths (see
below)
* the additional Paths must either be formed from the _EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength_
within the ConnectedEdgeSet or are of type SubEdge

[[fig23]]
.EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint
image::img23.png[]

The main topological structure consists of the following subtypes of
RepresentationItems:

* _Vertex_
* _Edge_
* _EdgeWithLength_
* _ConnectedEdgeSet_
* _Path_

These items are grouped together in an
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_.

An _Edge_ is starting in one _Vertex_ and is ending in another _Vertex_. Because of
this an _Edge_ has a direction. An _EdgeWithLength_ is an _Edge_ for which the
length is defined. _Edges_ that are connected with each other through common
vertices can be grouped together in a _ConnectedEdgeSet_. A _ConnectedEdgeSet_
defines a directed graph that may be cyclic (in other words, it may contain loops).
Within this graph _Paths_ can be specified that consists of an ordered list of
connected _Edges_ and a corresponding ordered list of boolean values for the
orientation of the _Edges_. The _Edges_ in a _Path_ are constrained, so that the
start _Vertex_ of a following _Edge_ must start at the end _Vertex_ of a previous
_Edge_. As needed the direction of an Edge can be inverted in its usage by the
corresponding boolean attribute in the _OrientationList_.

Sub-topological structures can be defined on the main topological structure or a
higher sub-topological structure with the following _RepresentationItems_:

* _SubEdge_
* _VertexOnEdge_
* _ConnectedEdgeSubSet_

A _SubEdge_ is an _Edge_ that represents a portion of a _ParentEdge_. A _SubEdge_
might have the same start or same end Vertex or none of the Vertices of the parent
_Edge_. In all other cases the start and end Vertex of a SubEdge must be VertexOnEdge.

A _VertexOnEdge_ is a _Vertex_ on a parent Edge that is an EdgeWithLength in a defined
distance from either the start or the end Vertex. A VertexOnEdge must only be
referenced by SubEdges with the same parent Edge.

A _ConnectedEdgeSubSet_ is a _ConnectedEdgeSet_ that defines a sub-set of connected
Edges of a ParentEdgeSet.

A _EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ is a _Representation_
that consists of exactly one _ConnectedEdgeSet_ (with all the underlying edges and
vertices) and any number of _Paths_ on that _ConnectedEdgeSet_ and any number of
additional _SubEdges_ and _VertexOfEdges_ defined on the _Edges_ of the
_ConnectedEdgeSet_.

As with all kinds of _Representations_, the _RepresentationItems_ are defined under
the _Items_ section of a _RepresentationContext_ and referenced in the Items section
of a _EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_. Several
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ can be defined under the
same RepresentationContext, and thus allowing to share the same RepresentationItems.

=== Example Topological Harness Representation

Extract taken from HarnessExample_Hierarchical.xml:

The RepresentationContext _321000 is of type
EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraints with a DimensionCount of 1.
All length values are given in Metres. Within this context three
EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraints are defined. The first one
(_321010) defines the complete harness topology for the H1 example, while the other
two defines sub-sets of the main one (_323010 for "H1-a" and _323010 for "H1-b");

Example of some topological representation items that are contained within
_RepresentationContext/Items_:

The _ConnectedEdgeSet_ _321020 consists of five __Edges__ that are referenced. One of
them is "_321023" that is has the specific subtype __EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength__ and
that is given the name S3. The underlying geometry of this edge is defined by the
curve "_341023" with the specific subtype __BoundedCurveWithLength__ with a length of
2.0 m. The __EdgeBoundedCurveWithLength__ is an edge between two vertices. One of them
(the __EdgeEnd__) is "_321043" that is of the specific subtype VertexPoint and that
references for its geometry the Point "_341043".

The Path "_321065" consists of the two edges ("_321022" and "_321023"). The
OrientationList contains the values TRUE and FALSE. This means that the first edge
is followed as defined (from EdgeStart to EdgeEnd), while the second edge is
followed in inverse order (EdgeEnd to EdgeStart). Consequently the path starts with
the EdgeStart of the first edge and ends with the EdgeStart of the second edge.

Example of sub-topological elements for the main topological elements defined above:
The VertexOnEdge _321051 with the name X1 is defined on the Edge _321023 (S3) at a
distance of 0.8 m from Vertex _321044 (N4). The SubEdge _321035 (S3-2) is defined on
_321023 (S3) between the start vertex _321051 (X1) and the end vertex _321044 (N4).
Another SubEdge _321034 (S3-1) is defined on the same parent edge between the start
vertex _321051 (X1) and the end vertex _321043 (N3). Because the main edge S3 is 2.0
m long, a receiving system can deduce that the length of the S3-1 SubEdge is 1.2 m.
The ConnectedEdgeSubSet defines a sub-set of Edges from the parent _321020 and
contains the main edge _321022 (S2), the sub-edge _321034 (S-1) and others.

=== Direction control of Edges and Paths

Both, Edges and Paths have a dedicated direction. For an Edge the direction is
defined from the EdgeStart to the EdgeEnd. For a Path the direction is defined from
one of the Vertices of the first Edge to one of the Vertices of the last Edge:

* If for the first Edge the OrientationList is TRUE, then the Path starts with its
EdgeStart, otherwise with its EdgeEnd.
* If for the last Edge the OrientationList is TRUE, then the Path ends with its
EdgeEnd, otherwise with its EdgeStart.

Two consecutive Edges in a Path must share a common VertexPoint. On whether this the
EdgeStart or the EdgeEnd of these Edges depends on the corresponding values in the
OrientationList:

* If the preceding Edge has an OrientationList value of TRUE, its EdgeEnd is used;
otherwise its EdgeStart.
* If the succeeding Edge has an OrientationList value of TRUE, its EdgeStart is
used; otherwise its EdgeEnd.

The following figure shows an example of a _Path_ consisting of 3 _Edges_ of type
_EdgeBoundesCurveWithLength_:

[[fig24]]
.Example of Edge and Path directions
image::img24.png[]

For the purpose of electrical wire harness the chosen directions of singleEdges and
Paths don't matter. However the chosen directions of all the Edges and Paths must be
consistent with each other.

[[cls-14.4]]
=== External References for Geometry

As the AP242 DomainModel and its XML encoding do not support detailed geometric
representations there is a need to reference traditional STEP files in p21 format
that contain the needed geometry. The reference from the DomainModel XML file to the
p21 file and then to specific entity instances in that files requires a sequence of
steps.

. a _FormatProperty_ defines the _DataFormat_ of the external file, e.g. one that is
defined by "AP 10303-214".
. a _DigitalFile_ identifies the external file. If refers to the _FormatProperty_ so
that the type of external file is known on the XML level. With _FileLocations_ the
information where to find the file can be provided. Attribute _SourceId_ of
_FileLocationIdentification_ is used for the file name.
. _ExternalGeometricModel_, that is a wrapper on the XML level for an external
geometry model, refers to the _DigtialFile_ that contains the geometric model.
. In the case that the external file contains more than one external geometric
model, it is essential to specify which one. This is done through the attribute
_ExternalItem_.
. In the case that the external file is a STEP p21 file, _ExternalItem_ shall be of
type _ExternalEntityInstance_ with the _Id_ attribute specifying either the local
instance ID that is used in the data section of the p21 file (e.g. "#1234") or the
external anchor name that can be provided in the anchor section of a p21 file
(available from edition 3 on).
. an _ExternalGeometryModel_ contain one or more _RepresentationItems_, some of
which might be _ExternalRepresentationItems_. This can be use to replicate entity
instances of an external p21 file on the XML level so that they can be references by
other XML elements.
. There are cases when it is not sufficient to just reference a particular entity
instance in a p21 file but there is a need to follow a chain of entity instances
that provide essential context information. This can be done by
_NextInstanceForward_ and _NextInstanceInverse_. Both specify the _AttributeName_ to
follow and the NextInstance in the chain of instances. For _NextInstanceForward_,
_AttributeName_ specified an attribute of the current instance, while for
_NextInstanceInverse_, _AttributeName_ specifies an attribute of the _NextInstance_.

[CAUTION,type=""]
====
There had been a change from AP242 edition 1 to edition 2 on the attributes of
_DigitalFile_. With edition 2 the attribute _FileLocation_ was added (in green
colour), replacing the attribute _Locations_ (red colour) from edition 1. For an XML
file generated according to AP242 edition 2, the _Locations_ attribute must not be
used.

==== External References to geometry files (as a whole)

For an explanation and example on how to use an _ExternalGeometricModel_ to
reference into a _DigitalFile_ as a whole see the Recommended Practices for "Product
& Assembly Structure".

[[cls-14.4.2]]
==== Example of External Element References into p21 file

For the purpose of electrical wire harness it is often essential to not only
reference an external file that but also to reference to specific elements of an
external file. This clause provides an example of how to reference an external STEP
file and within this file reference to 3 specific entity instances, one that is a
_representation_ and two __representation_items__.

Extract taken from HarnessExample_Flat.xml:

. _FileFormat_ "_100300" defines a file type according to the "ISO 10303-214"
standard.
. _DigitalFile_ "_103080" references this FileFormat and defines the __SourceId__
"c-51864-1-af-3d.stp" as the name of the STEP file. It is assumed that this STEP
file contains only a single __Representation__.
. _GeometricCoordinateSpace_ "_103091" contains a single __Representation__ of type
__ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation__ that specified as its external file the
__DigitalFile__ (see above). As the file may contain several representation instances,
the exact one is specified by __ExternalItem__.
. The _ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_ contains 3 _RepresentationItems_.
two of which are of type _ExternalRepresentationItem_ and references to some
_ExternalEntityInstance_ in the digital file. The third one is an _AxisPlacement_
that is needed for positioning inside the XML file.
. A PartView of some Part/PartVersion specifies the above
_ExternalAdvancedBrepShapeRepresentation_ as its RepresentedGeometry..
. The _PartView_ contains two _ShapeElements_ (here of type _PartTerminals_) that
defines the above _ExternalRepresentationItems_ as their RepresentedGeometry
respectively.

Through this chain of references the two ShapeElements are linked to two specific
RepresentationItems in the external GeometryModel.
