== ProductConcept/Class and ProductConfiguration

A similar concept to the combination of _Part_, _PartVersion_ and _PartView_ is
available with the combination of _ProductClass_ and _ProductConfiguration_. The
main difference is that a _Part_ has a part-Number (=id) by which it is identified.
Also a _PartView_ is expected to provide all needed details for a given
_ApplicationDomain_ (e.g. "electrical") and _LiveCycleStage_ (e.g. "design").
_ProductConcept_ together with _ProductConfiguration_ on the other hand provides
only a few characteristics needed for market presentation. There are no design
details. However for variant products _Specifications_ can be used to characterize
the high level (alternative) options that are available for a _ProductClass_.

[CAUTION,type=recommendation]
====
Use subtype _ProductClass_ always. On the MIM/IR level this is
required to have any property values defined for this.
====

There are two main usages for the use of _ProductClass_ & _ProductConfiguration_,
one is for the usage of standard piece parts for which only *catalogue data* is
available, but no further detailed information. The other use is for the
configuration of *high end products* that may come in many different configurations.
This usage comes together with the concept of Product _Specifications_ that are not
covered in this tutorial.

While _ProductClass_ & _ProductConfiguration_ represents a *customer view*, there
might be one or several corresponding Part/PartVersion and PartView to represent
detailed *design view*. A _ProductDesignAssociation_ links between the customer view
and the design view.

A single _Part/PartVersion_ and _PartView_ might be used to capture the design
information of several similar _ProductConfigurations_ (typically of the same
_ProductClass_). For this case the _PartView_ (typically subtype
_AssemblyDefinition_) has to contain all the needed alternative and optional
assembly components and _ShapeFeatures_. So the design contains more than what can
actually be manufactured for a single individual. Such a design is called a 150%
product structure. _ConfiguredAssemblyEffectivity_ is used to select the 100% out of
the 150% of the product structure that applies for the associated
_ProductConfiguration_.

Both, _ProductConfiguration_ and _PartView_ can be used as _Definition_ for
_DefinitionBasedOccurrences_ that may show up in a WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign. To
support this both, _ProductConfiguration_ and _PartView_ can have
_PropertyValueAssignments_ (e.g. "open-circuit voltage" = 12V) and _PartTerminals_
(e.g. "PLUS" and "MINUS" for the provided battery example).

[[cls-6.1]]
=== Standard piece parts

In this example a standard battery of 12V and a capacity of 100Ah is defined. No
design details are provided. For further details such as classification and
properties see <<cls-7>>. A SingleOccurrence with id "battery1" is defined for this
kind of battery that can then be used in an assembly (see <<cls-8>>).

=== Top level assembly with 150% product structure

Example taken out of HarnessExample_Hierachical.xml:

A _ProductClass_ for the harness H1 is defined that contains two alternative
_ProductConfigurations_, one with a stereo plug and the other with 2 hookup lugs.
Both _ProductConfigurations_ are associated to the same
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ "_311001" (sub-subtype of __PartView__).

The first _ProductConfiguration_ disables the occurrences for lug3 and lug4 as well
as the corresponding _AssemblyShapeJoints_ for these 2 lugs. In the second
_ProductConfiguration_ the phone1 connector is disabled together with the
corresponding _AssemblyShapeJoints_ (subtypes of _ShapeElement_) that connects the
phone1 terminals.

=== Highly configurable end product with Specifications and ProductBreakdown

For a wiring harness assembly design with very many variants it might be more useful
to use a Breakdown structure. AP242 provides this capability, however as of today no
example has been worked out for a wiring harness.
