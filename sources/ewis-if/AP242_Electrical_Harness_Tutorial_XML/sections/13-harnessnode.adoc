== HarnessNode and HarnessSegment

A _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ is an _AssemblyDefinition_ in which all the physical
elements and the physical connectivity of an electrical harness is defined. Unless
the harness has a very primitive structure, it refers to a
_EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint_ that defines the
topological structure.

A _HarnessSegment_ is a kind of _PartShapeElement_ for a
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ that links an _Edge_ from the topological
representation of the harness to a _CrossSectionalGroupShapeElement_. For
manufacturing purpose the length of a referenced _Edge_ can be overridden by the
ForcedLength attribute.

A _HarnessNode_ is another kind of _PartShapeElement_ for a
_WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ that links a _Vertex_ from the topological
representation to an _OccurrenceShapeElement_ that represents an aspect of an
_Occurrence_. With the attribute NodeType it is possible to characterise the kind of
node:

* branch node: A node that is used by more than one Edge or HarnessSegment. The
nodes N3 and N4 of the example are of this kind.
* extremity node: A node that is used by a single Edge or HarnessSegment. The nodes
N1, N2, N5 and N6 of the example are of this kind.
* external node: A node in a partial harness design that is used by a single Edge or
HarnessSegment and that is indicating that the harness continues beyond that node in
another design. The node X4 in the example is of this kind for the sub-harnesses
H1.a and H1.b.
* intermediate node: Additional nodes defined on Edges. The nodes X1, X2, X3, X4
(for H1), X5 and X6 of the example are of this type.

The main topological structure of a wiring harness is defined by the edges and
vertices of the EdgeBasedTopologicalRepresentationWithLengthConstraint. The
additional HarnessSegment and Harness Node objects have to be used when there:

* is a need for additional properties;
* to link with cross-sectional structure by HarnessSegment.CrossSection;
* to link with a feature of a connector, fastener or other rigid component by
HarnessNode.AttachedFeature.
