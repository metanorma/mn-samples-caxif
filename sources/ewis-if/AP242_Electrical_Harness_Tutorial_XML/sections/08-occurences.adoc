== Occurrences and Multi-level Assembly Structure

AP242 allows to build up single and multi level assembly structures. Each assembly,
either a top assembly or an intermediate sub-assembly, is represented by an
_AssemblyDefinition_ that is a subtype of _PartView_. The "components" of an
_AssemblyDefinition_ are subtypes of _Occurrence_ that are related into the assembly
through _AssemblyOccurrenceRelationships_. Its supertype
_ViewOccurrenceRelationship_ allows in a generic way to relate an _Occurrence_ to a
_PartView_.

In cases that a set of Occurrences belong together but are not physically combined
with each other a _CollectionDefinition_ is to be used, that is also a subtype of
PartView.

An AssemblyDefinition is the relating target of an AssemblyOccurrenceRelationship
that is a subtype of ViewOccurrenceRelationship that in a generic way establishes a
relation between an Occurrence and a PartView. An AssemblyOccurrenceRelationship is
either a NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage or a PromissoryAssemblyOccurrenceUsage. A
NextAssemblyOccurrenceUsage makes an Occurrence a direct constituent of an
AssemblyDefinition. A PromissoryAssemblyOccurrenceUsage only indicates that an
Occurrence may become an constituent in some way, maybe in some indirect way.

An Occurrence may be defined in three different ways:

. In most cases an Occurrence is a particular usage of a PartView that inherits all
its attributes including the geometric models from the PartView unless it is said
otherwise.
. But an Occurrence may also be a usage of a ProductConfiguration that is a member
of a ProductClass. This case is used especially for standard parts that are bought
off the shelf with only limited design information.
. A third case is when an Occurrence is defined by a lower level Occurrence in the
context of a higher level Occurrence. The specific subtype SpecifiedOccurrence is
used in this case, see below and clause 5.6.

Occurrence itself is an abstract concept. One of the following subtype has to be used:

* A DefinitionBasedOccurrence is an Occurrence that is also abstract and that has as
its definition either a PartView or a ProductConfiguration (but not another
Occurrence).
** A SingleOccurrence is a DefinitionBasedOccurrence that is taken from its
definition as a single piece.
** A QuantifiedOccurrence is a DefinitionBasedOccurrence that is taken from its
definition in some quantity. The quantity can be defined in the number of pieces
(e.g. 10 rivets), or by length (e.g. 2m wire), or by surface (e.g. 3 sqm. of glass)
or by volume (2.5 litre of oil). It the quantity can not be specified exactly an
alternative criterion can be specified (e.g. enough glue for the whole surface). At
least either the quantity or the criterion must be specified.
* A SpecifiedOccurrence is an Occurrence that has as its definition another
Occurrence. This definition is used by a NextAssemblyUsage in an AssemblyDefinition.
In parallel the SpecifiedOccurrence calls out by the attribute UpperUsage one more
other Occurrence, that has as its Definition (directly or indirectly) this
AssemblyDefinition.

A single or multi level assembly structure shall form a directed acyclic graph.
_ProductConfigurations_, _PartViews_, _AssemblyDefinitions_ and _Occurrences_ are
the nodes, while _AssemblyOccurrenceRelationships_, and the attribute
_Occurrence.Definition_ are the links between the nodes in this graph. Other than
that this graph shall be "directed" and "acyclic" the following constraints apply:

* An Occurrence can be related at most once into an AssemblyDefinition, but an
Occurrence can be related several times into different AssemblyDefinitions; e.g. to
represent variants.
* In the case that an Occurrence is defined by a PartView, this PartView must not be
the AssemblyDefinition into which the Occurrence is related to nor any of its higher
AssemblyDefinitions.
* PartViews or AssemblyDefinitions at different levels of an assembly structure
shall not share the same PartVersion nor the same Part.

See the "Recommended Practices for AP242 Business Object Model XML Assembly
Structure" for detailed information on how to implement assembly structures in
general.

Clause 5.6 provides a detailed example of a hierarchical assembly structure with
SpecifiedOccurrence.

[CAUTION,type=attention]
====
Do not use the types AssemblyViewRelationship, NextAssemblyViewUsage and
PromissoryAssemblyViewUsage for electrical harness. These types had been introduced
in AP242 for the harmonization with AP239 (PLCS), but they do in no way support the
functionality needed for electrical harness.

====

The attribute Id of Occurrences shall be unique within all Occurrences used within
an AssemblyDefinition. It is used as reference designator. In most cases a simple
IdentifierString is sufficient. If there is a need to call out a specific reference
designator system (e.g. IEC, IEEE or company specific) the Identifier Object with a
Classification can be used.

See an overview of "IEC Reference Designations" at: +
http://myelectrical.com/notes/entryid/24/iec-reference-designations

The attribute Id of ViewOccurrenceRelationship and all its subtypes is optional.
Recommendation is to not use this attribute.
