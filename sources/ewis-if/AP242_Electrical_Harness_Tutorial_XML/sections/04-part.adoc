== Part, PartVersion, Part category

Objects of type *Part* are used for the all the parts that are used to build an
electrical harness. In addition an electrical harness is modelled as Part as well, so
that it can be used in a next higher assembly; e.g. for a complete aircraft. For each
Part at least one PartVersion shall be defined. A PartVersion may have one or several
views (see next chapter).

A wire part that is provided as bulk material. For the usage of the _Part_ in an
_Occurrence_ it needs to be cut to a specific length.

The main attributes for a Part are its Id (used as master part number without version
information) and Name. For the design exchange of electrical harness the
specification of a part category is essential so that a receiving system can filter
the data in a certain way. In this example the pre-defined category "wire" is used.

[[cls-4.1]]
=== Generic Predefined Part Categories

AP242 defines the following generic categories (not specific for electrical harness):

* *application control*: this type of classification is used to indicate that a part
shall be considered under certification aspects
+
--
[example]
====
Prior to the release of a new car to the market, both function and quality of certain
parts have to be certified by an authority, e.g., the department of transportation.
For such item objects, certification requirements have to be considered during the
design phase.
====
--
* *assembly*: this type of classification shall be used for any part that has an
_AssemblyDefinition_ provided for at least one of its versions, i.e., it is
decomposed further;
* *boxed*: specifies the role of the boxed part;
+
--
[example]
A can with one litre of a specific oil.
--
* *collection*: this type of classification shall be used for any part that has a
_CollectionDefinition_ provided for at least one of its versions;
* *completely knocked down*: this type of classification is used to indicate that a
part is used in a production site that has assembling facilities only;
+
--
[example]
The 'completely knocked down' may indicate that the components are shipped to and
assembled in a different country.
--
* *continuous*: this type of classification is used to indicate the part that can be
measured by its volume or weight;
* *detail*: this type of classification shall be used for any part that has no
_AssemblyDefinition_ provided for any of its versions, i.e., it is not further
decomposed;
* *discrete*: this type of classification is used to indicate that a part is one
single piece.
* *in process*: this type of classification is used to indicate that the part
identifies an intermediate object in a manufacturing process;
+
--
NOTE: Detailed information about the stage the part has within the manufacturing
process may be obtained from the _ProcessOperationOccurrence_.
--
* *inseparable assembly*: the part plays the role of an inseparable assembly;
* *prototype*: this type of classification is used to indicate that the part
identifies a prototype and is not intended for serial production;
* *raw material*: the part plays the role of raw material;
* *raw material by area*: the part plays the role of raw material, cut by area, e.g.
chipboard;
* *raw material by length*: the part plays the role of raw material, cut by length,
e.g. cable;
* *raw material by volume*: the part plays the role of raw material, cut by volume,
e.g. a raw block of marble or oil;
* *regulated*: this type of classification is used to indicate that for a part
certain regulations have to be considered;
* *safety*: this type of classification is used to indicate that a part is relevant
for safety purposes;
* *service*: this type of classification is used to indicate that a part is relevant
for service purposes;
* *tool*: the part plays the role of a tool.

[RECOMMENDATION]
====
For the purpose of an electrical wire harness design, most Parts
require a part category of either "**discrete**" or "**raw material by length**". In
special cases "**raw material by area**" or "**raw material by volume**" might be
used alternatively.

=== Part and ProductClass Categories specific for Electrical Harness and other electrical applications

Here the pre-defined categories for electrical harness and other electrical
applications. Most of these categories are standardized by IEC in the Electropedia:
http://www.electropedia.org/

[IMPORTANT]
====
Preprocessors are required to provide the following part categories if they apply.
This is needed so that a post-processor can be configures to act properly on the on
the incoming information and sort the parts suitable for the receiving system.
====

* *wiring harness*: assembly with a harness topology, consisting of cables or wires
to enable electrical or optical connectivity, grouped together in one or more harness

== Example part with PartCategories

Here an example of a _Part_ with a single _PartVersion_ (at least one is mandatory). The
part categories tells an importing tool on how to handle the part. In this case we
know that it is a *discrete* part, and so it comes in pieces, not in some quantity such
as length, area or volume that one would need to specify before it can be used (see
subtypes of Occurrence). Another important information is that it is a
*connector_contact*; so it is something that is used to assembly a connector and that
it is a part that most likely has electrical or optical connectivity functionality.
