== ShapeElements, Features & Beyond

A *ShapeElement* identifies a piece of the shape of some product or of another
ShapeElement, but without defining its geometry. Some subtypes of ShapeElements are
called ...ShapeFeature. The term "shape feature" in AP242 means that some piece of
the outside surface of a product is identified that typically has a specific
functional purpose. A shape feature is a "definitional" part of the shape of a
product. There are other shapes of a product that are not definitional, e.g. a
rotational axis is not part of the outer surface of a product.

A *ShapeFeatureDefinition* is the identification of a feature independent of a
particular product. It can be used like a template for several products. This
concept is widely used in the electrical world for standardized shapes of e.g.
connectors or contacts.

.ShapeElement and ShapeFeatureDefinition

ShapeElements can in principle be defined for ProductConfiguration, PartView,
Occurrence, IndividualPartView, AssemblyViewRelationship, BreakdownElementType or
ShapeFeatureDefinition. For the purpose of electrical harness only the following
specific subtypes of ShapeElements or one of their subsubtypes are to be used:

* *PartShapeElement* and subtype PartFeature for PartView or ProductConfiguration
* *OccurrenceShapeElement* and subtype OccurrenceShapeFeature for Occurrences
* *ShapeFeatureDefinitionElement* for ShapeFeatureDefinition

ShapeElements can be related in various ways to each other using
ShapeElementRelationship. A PartShapeElementRelationship relates two
PartShapeElements that might be from the same PartView or from different PartViews.
A PartFeatureFitRelationship indicates that two PartFeatures fit together like a
plug and a socket. ShapeFeatureDefinitionElementRelationship is providing the same
capability on a generic ShapeFeature level independent of a product.

The following pre-defined type information are defined for electrical wiring
harness. Whenever suitable these types should be used to enable the proper function
of converters:

* cavity_plug_or_contact_profile: an outer profile of a cavity plug or connector
contact that fits into a cavity_profile.
* cavity_profile: an inner profile of a connector cavity that can accept a
cavity_plug_or_contact_profile.
* contact_barrel: an inner profile of a barrel that can accept a wire_profile.
* contact_profile: an inner profile of a socket contact into which a pin_profile fits.
* insert_profile: an outer profile of a connector insert that fits into a
slot_profile.
* pin_profile: an outer profile of a pin contact that fits into a contact_profile.
* plug_profile: an outer profile of a plug that fits into a socket_profile.
* slot_profile: an inner profile of a connector slot that can accept an
insert_profile.
* socket_profile: an inner profile of a socket into which a plug_profile fits.
* unspecified: the kind of shape is not specified.
* wire_profile: an outer profile of a wire or cable that fits into a contact_barrel.

=== Templates for Slots, Inserts, Cavities and Contact Profiles

In the cases that a particular shape feature is used for several PartDesignViews
there is a possibility to define a feature only once, and then to used it for
several PartDesignViews by reference.

Examples for this are modular connectors such as the ARINC 600 series that are
available from different vendors and variations and where different kind of inserts
fit into the same slot, or different kind of contacts fit into a cavity of a certain
size and shape.
