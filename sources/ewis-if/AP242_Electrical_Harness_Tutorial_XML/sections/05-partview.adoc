== PartView and ViewContext

The meaning and structure for _Part_, _PartVersion_, _PartView_ with reference to
ViewContext and also how to associate a geometric model is explained in great detail
in the AP242 BO-Model XML Assembly Structure document and so we do not need to repeat
this here.

The specifics for electrical harness, compared to the Assembly Structure Recommended
Practises, is explained in the following sub-clauses:

[[cls-5.1]]
=== ViewContext: ApplicationDomain

A _PartView_ shall have at least one _ViewContext_ for the _InitialContext_ and may
have further _ViewContexts_ as _AdditionalContexts_. In the recommended practises for
assembly design an example of a _ViewContext_ with the _ApplicationDomain_
"**mechanical design**" and the _LifeCycleStage_ "**design**" is provided. This
clause defines the values for _ApplicationDomain_ and _LifeCycleStage_ to be used for
the purpose of electrical wire harness.

[CAUTION,type=""]
====
For the design of an electrical harness the _ViewContexts_ of the harness view itself
and the ones of all assembled underlying _Part/PartVersion/PartViews_ shall have the
value "design" for the _LifeCycleStage_ attribute.
====

[CAUTION,type=""]
====
For the purpose of the design of an electrical harness the _ApplicationDomain_
"**electrical**" shall be used for all _PartViews_ that define elements relevant for
the electrical or optical connectivity such as electrical terminals and nodes. When
this _ApplicationDomain_ is used for a _PartView_ it tells an importing tool that all
relevant electrical connectivity information is provided. The _ApplicationDomain_
"**electrical**" may be used as either _InitialContext_ or _AdditionalContexts_.
====

As detailed in the assembly recommended practises, an _AssemblyDefinition_ is a
specialization of a _PartView_ that is to be used to define an assembly of parts. In
the case that the assembly of an electrical harness is defined, the sub-subtype
_**WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign**_ shall be used . The following values for the
_ApplicationDomain_ of additional contexts for a _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ are
defined:

* electrical: the application domain is electrical. This value should be used for all
parts that have electrical relevant content such as terminals (e.g. a connector) or
conductors (e.g. a wire).
* the exchange content of a wiring harness assembly view can be stated by these
pre-defined values:
** wiring_harness_assembly_3d_design: a 3D geometry model of the harness topology of
a wiring harness assembly.
** wiring_harness_assembly_design_stick_line: a stick line drawing of a wiring
harness assembly.
** wiring_harness_formboard_drawing: a formboard drawing of a wiring harness assembly.
** wiring_harness_formboard_drawing: the application domain comprises a formboard
drawing of a wiring harness assembly.
** wiring_harness_segment_topology: the complete harness topology of a wiring harness
assembly.

For a simple harness design there is only one _PartView_ of type
_**WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign**_. However for complex design there might be the need
to split a harness into several partial harnesses that are manufactured independently
and only combined into a single one during installation. For a rather big harness it
might be needed to split the complete harness design into several partial harness
designs for which separate teams are responsible; and that may be versioned
independently. The model also supports the design process from high level concepts
down to detailed designs and be able to trace through the accumulated data from
version to version. The completion state of a _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_ is
indicated by its application domain to cover one or more of these

* complete_design: the PartView that represents a complete design.
* partial_design_interface: the PartView that represents the interface between two or
more partial designs. wire_and_part_list_with_connectivity: all wires and wire caps,
cables, connectors, and associated material, contact members, terminal lugs, terminal
blocks, splices and electrically non-conductive through termination, electrical
shielding definition in the assembly, tape marking of a wiring harness assembly.
* partial_design_interface: the PartView that represents the interface between two or
more partial designs.

*Harness Structures*:

[TODO]
====
*xxxx Provide only references to later clause on HarnesSegment, HarnesNode,
Connectivity, topology ....*

An electrical wire harness is primarily build up of flexible segments that contain
the wire and cables and that are connected by branch nodes and extremity nodes for
the connectors. The data structure in AP242 is a bit more complex than this as the
use cases also require to represent partial harnesses and the way harnesses are built
up and installed later on. To support this (and as a general STEP approach) the
HarnessSegments and HarnessNodes are specific to a single WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign
and reference to a topological harness model that can be shared by several partial
designs or designs representing different states of the development process. The
topological model consists primarily of Edges and Nodes. For very simple designs
there is a one-to-one relation between HarnessNode and Vertex on one hand, and
HarnessSegment and Edge on the other hand. However for a bit more complex case the
need to work with several related harness design views is essential. The link between
common HarnessNodes and common HarnessSegments of different
WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign of the same final Part is established by common Edges and
Vertices within a common RepresentationContext.

=== Examples: simple electrical PartView

Example taken from HarnessExample_Hierarchical.stpx: A _Part/PartVersion_ that is
categorized to be a "*terminal lug*" and "discrete" with a single PartVersion and
PartView. The PartView has an initial ViewContext with the ApplicationDomain
"electrical" and LifeCycleStage "design". There are two _SingleOccurrences_, "lug1" and
"lug2" defined for the PartView. See <<cls-8>> for using these occurrences in an
assembly.

=== Example: simple WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign

Example taken from HarnessExample_Hierarchical.stpx:

A _Part_ with the categories "wiring_harness" and "discrete" is defined. Its single
_PartVersion_ contains a _PartView_ of type _WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign_. As all
other PartViews used for design of an electrical wire harness this has an initial
ViewContext with the ApplicationDomain "electrical" and LifeCycleStage "design".
There are two additional ViewContexts defined for this design view. By ViewContexts
"_100104" with the ApplicationDomain "wiring_harness_segment_topology" it is made
clear that the __WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign__ contains a complete topological
representation. By ViewContexts "_100105" with the ApplicationDomain
"wire_and_part_list_with_connectivity" it is made clear that the
__WiringHarnessAssemblyDesign__ contains all electrical relevant occurrences such as
wires, cables, connectors, contacts, terminal lugs and more.
