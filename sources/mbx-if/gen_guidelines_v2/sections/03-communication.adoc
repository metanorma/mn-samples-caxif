and associated working groups up to date on current testing activities and agreements.

=== Web Sites

The MBx Interoperability Forum maintains an internet homepage, which is mirrored at 
three URLs:

* https://www.mbx-if.de/
* https://www.mbx-if.eu/
* https://www.mbx-if.org/

The contents at all locations are identical. Only in the context of updates it may 
happen that the sites are out of sync temporarily, depending on the availability of 
the respective web master. These pages cover general information about the MBx-IF, as 
well as all public information on the CAx, CAE and EWIS domains. This includes 
Recommended Practices, Test Suite documents, and information on implementation support.

The PDM has a separate homepage, as it joined the MBx-IF at a later point in time. It 
can be found at:

* http://www.pdm-if.org/

In the near future, it is planned to merge all of these web pages into one.
