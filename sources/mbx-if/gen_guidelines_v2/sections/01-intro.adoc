== MBx-IF Introduction

STEP is an established ISO standard (ISO 10303) for the exchange of product data 
between different CAx and PDM/PLM systems. To promote the international use of the 
standard, AFNeT, PDES, Inc. and prostep ivip have created the Model-Based "x" 
Interoperability Forum (MBx-IF) as a new umbrella organization for the established 
CAx-IF, PDM-IF and EWIS-IF projects. The goal of the new joint project is to 
accelerate the development of STEP interfaces and ensure that user requirements are 
met.

The MBx umbrella organization is intended to intensify the further development of the 
STEP standard through cross-domain integration. It provides a trusted environment for 
user companies and software vendors to openly discuss requirements and technical 
challenges, develop a common understanding of the various topics, and derive robust 
approaches to implementation. Thus, each domain is comprised of a dedicated User 
Group and an Implementor Group:

* The *User Group* (UG) consists of industry representatives who define and 
prioritize industry requirements, test cases and acceptance criteria for CAx 
capabilities in scope of AP242.
* The *Implementor Group* (IG) is composed of CAx system developers and vendors of 
STEP translation and validation tools, implementing AP242 interfaces. It develops 
Recommended Practices based on industry needs and validates them in the CAx test 
rounds.

The goals of the MBx Interoperability Forumâ€™s Implementor Groups are to:

* Implement functionality for today's needs
* Identify functionality for tomorrow's needs
* Avoid roadblocks by establishing agreed upon approaches
* Increase user confidence by providing system and AP interoperability testing
* Ensure new functionality does not adversely impact existing implementations
* Significantly improve STEP translator quality and decrease translator time-to-market

This document is aimed at new members of any of the MBx-IF IGs to familiarize 
themselves with the corresponding infrastructure and procedures.
