== MBx-IF Infrastructure

In addition to the public web pages (see <<sec-3.1>>), the MBx-IF provides additional 
infrastructure for internal communication, tracking, and testing. Each of these tools 
requires a personal login.

[[sec-4.1]]
=== CAESAR

CAESAR is the central information hub for all Implementor Groups within the MBx-IF. 
It servers two main purposes:

* *Test Evaluation* -- by capturing statistics for each test case, calculating the 
corresponding results, and supporting resolution of issues
* *Issue Tracking* -- for documenting and following up on technical issues.

CAESAR can be accessed at the following location:

https://www.mbx-if.de/caesar/

[[sec-4.1.1]]
==== Registration

CAESAR requires an individual login for each user. To get a login, please get in 
touch with the CAxIF facilitators:

* Jochen Boy (jochen.bpy@prostep.com)
* Phil Rosché (phil.rosche@accr-llc.com)

Once your account has been created, you can use the “Reset Password” link on the 
login page to set up your credentials and activate your account.

[[sec-4.1.2]]
==== Using CAESAR

Once you’re logged in to CAESAR, there is a comprehensive User Guide as well as a 
Frequently Asked Questions section available in the “Documentation” section of the 
Main Menu:

=== Nextcloud

Nextcloud is the file sharing platform shared by all teams under the MBx-IF umbrella. 
It can be found at the following location:

https://nextcloud.boost-lab.net/nextcloud/

[[sec-4.2.1]]
==== Registration

Nextcloud requires an individual login for each user. To get a login, please get in 
touch with any of the MBx-IF facilitators:

*CAx-IF IG*:

* Jochen Boy (jochen.bpy@prostep.com)
* Phil Rosché (phil.rosche@accr-llc.com)

*CAx-IF UG*:

* Pierre Duchier (pierre.p.duchier@airbus.com)

*EWIS-IF IG & UG*:

* Lothar Klein (lothar.klein@lksoft.com)
* Dan Ganser (dan.ganser@gulfstream.com)

*PDM-IF IG & UG*:

* Guillaume Hirel (guillaume.hirel@t-systems.com)
* Kevin Le Tutour (kevin.letutour@afnet-services.fr)

They will create an account for you if needed. You will the receive an email with a 
link to set your initial password, thus activating your account.

The facilitators will also assign you to the correct user groups within Nextcloud, 
which will enable you to access that group’s folders.

[[sec-4.2.2]]
==== Using Nextcloud

Though Nextcloud does support direct integration and synchronization with Windows 
Explorer via WebDAV, it is recommended to use the browser interface to avoid 
interference with other installations.

Comprehensive documentation on how to use Nextcloud is available from the “Help” 
section in the personal menu, which you open by clicking on your avatar in the top 
right-hand corner of the Nextcloud web interface.

It is possible to link your Nextcloud account with your CAESAR account. Follow the 
instructions given on the “App Integration” tab of your CAESAR user profile to do so. 
This will enable you to browse and download content on Nextcloud from directly within 
CAESAR without having to switch between applications.

[[sec-4.3]]
=== Redmine

Redmine is used by the User Groups within the MBx-IF to track their requirements 
following the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) methodology. The tool can be found at the following URL:

https://rd.pdes-ch.org/

Implementors can join on Redmine as well. They will be granted a read-only access, so 
that they can follow along with current discussions.

[[sec-4.3.1]]
==== Registration

If you do not have a Redmine account yet, you can create one yourself by clicking on 
the “Register” link in the top right-hand corner of the Redmine homepage. Afterwards, 
please get in touch with the respective facilitators for the User Group of your 
domain to be added to that group:

*CAx-IF UG*:

* Pierre Duchier (pierre.p.duchier@airbus.com)
* Ian Parent (ian.parent@pwc.ca)

*PDM-IF UG*:

* Frédéric Darré (frederic.f.darre@airbus.com)
* Guillaume Hirel (guillaume.hirel@t-systems.com)
* Kevin Le Tutour (kevin.letutour@afnet-services.fr)

[[sec-4.3.2]]
==== Using Redmine

A user Guide is available by clicking on “Help” on the left side at the very top of 
the Redmine web interface.

It is possible to link your Redmine account with your CAESAR account. Follow the 
instructions given on the “App Integration” tab of your CAESAR user profile to do so. 
This will allow you to see information about user stories linked to test cases or 
technical issues directly within CAESAR without the need to switch between 
applications.
